Detection of Unauthorized IoT Devices Using Machine Learning Techniques;Yair Meidan, Michael Bohadana, Asaf Shabtai, Martin Ochoa, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, Juan Davis Guarnizo, Yuval Elovici;Security experts have demonstrated numerous risks imposed by Internet of Things (IoT) devices on organizations. Due to the widespread adoption of such devices, their diversity, standardization obstacles, and inherent mobility, organizations require an intelligent mechanism capable of automatically detecting suspicious IoT devices connected to their networks. In particular, devices not included in a white list of trustworthy IoT device types (allowed to be used within the organizational premises) should be detected. In this research, Random Forest, a supervised machine learning algorithm, was applied to features extracted from network traffic data with the aim of accurately identifying IoT device types from the white list. To train and evaluate multi-class classifiers, we collected and manually labeled network traffic data from 17 distinct IoT devices, representing nine types of IoT devices. Based on the classification of 20 consecutive sessions and the use of majority rule, IoT device types that are not on the white list were correctly detected as unknown in 96% of test cases (on average), and white listed device types were correctly classified by their actual types in 99% of cases. Some IoT device types were identified quicker than others (e.g., sockets and thermostats were successfully detected within five TCP sessions of connecting to the network). Perfect detection of unauthorized IoT device types was achieved upon analyzing 110 consecutive sessions perfect classification of white listed types required 346 consecutive sessions, 110 of which resulted in 99.49% accuracy. Further experiments demonstrated the successful applicability of classifiers trained in one location and tested on another. In addition, a discussion is provided regarding the resilience of our machine learning-based IoT white listing method to adversarial attacks.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04647
REMOTEGATE: Incentive-Compatible Remote Configuration of Security Gateways;Abhinav Aggarwal, Mahdi Zamani, Mihai Christodorescu;Imagine that a malicious hacker is trying to attack a server over the Internet and the server wants to block the attack packets as close to their point of origin as possible. However, the security gateway ahead of the source of attack is untrusted. How can the server block the attack packets through this gateway? In this paper, we introduce REMOTEGATE, a trustworthy mechanism for allowing any party (server) on the Internet to configure a security gateway owned by a second party, at a certain agreed upon reward that the former pays to the latter for its service. We take an interactive incentive-compatible approach, for the case when both the server and the gateway are rational, to devise a protocol that will allow the server to help the security gateway generate and deploy a policy rule that filters the attack packets before they reach the server. The server will reward the gateway only when the latter can successfully verify that it has generated and deployed the correct rule for the issue. This mechanism will enable an Internet-scale approach to improving security and privacy, backed by digital payment incentives.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04569
A review of approaches to the value of privacy;Miltiades E. Anagnostou, Maria A. Lambrou;In this paper we examine information privacy from a value-centered angle. We review and compare different personal data valuation approaches. We consider the value of personal data now and in the near future, and we find that the enduring part of personal data will soon become common knowledge and that their price and value will drop substantially. Therefore the sector that is based on personal data extraction will need to focus on new ways of monetization and on the of the dynamic part of personal information.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04767
A Learning Approach to Secure Learning;Linh Nguyen, Arunesh Sinha;Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been shown to be vulnerable against adversarial examples, which are data points cleverly constructed to fool the classifier. Such attacks can be devastating in practice, especially as DNNs are being applied to ever increasing critical tasks like image recognition in autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on the problem. We do so by first defining robustness of a classifier to adversarial exploitation. Next, we show that the problem of adversarial example generation and defense both can be posed as learning problems, which are duals of each other. We also show formally that our defense aims to increase robustness of the classifier. We demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques by experimenting with the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04447
Investigating Storage as a Service Cloud Platform: pCloud as a Case Study;Tooska Dargahi, Ali Dehghantanha, Mauro Conti;Due to the flexibility, affordability and portability of cloud storage, individuals and companies envisage the cloud storage as one of the preferred storage media nowadays. This attracts the eyes of cyber criminals, since much valuable informa- tion such as user credentials, and private customer records are stored in the cloud. There are many ways for criminals to compromise cloud services ranging from non-technical attack methods, such as social engineering, to deploying advanced malwares. Therefore, it is vital for cyber forensics examiners to be equipped and informed about best methods for investigation of different cloud platforms. In this chapter, using pCloud (an extensively used online cloud storage service) as a case study, and we elaborate on different kinds of artefacts retrievable during a forensics examination. We carried out our experiments on four different virtual machines running four popular operating systems: a 64 bit Windows 8, Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS, Android 4.4.2, and iOS 8.1. Moreover, we examined cloud remnants of two different web browsers: Internet Explorer and Google Chrome on Windows. We believe that our study would promote awareness among digital forensic examiners on how to conduct cloud storage forensics examination.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04417
On labeling Android malware signatures using minhashing and further classification with Structural Equation Models;Ignacio Martín, José Alberto Hernández, Sergio de los Santos;Multi-scanner Antivirus systems provide insightful information on the nature of a suspect application however there is often a lack of consensus and consistency between different Anti-Virus engines. In this article, we analyze more than 250 thousand malware signatures generated by 61 different Anti-Virus engines after analyzing 82 thousand different Android malware applications. We identify 41 different malware classes grouped into three major categories, namely Adware, Harmful Threats and Unknown or Generic signatures. We further investigate the relationships between such 41 classes using community detection algorithms from graph theory to identify similarities between them and we finally propose a Structure Equation Model to identify which Anti-Virus engines are more powerful at detecting each macro-category. As an application, we show how such models can help in identifying whether Unknown malware applications are more likely to be of Harmful or Adware type.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04186
Scalar multiplication in compressed coordinates in the trace-zero subgroup;Giulia Bianco, Elisa Gorla;We consider trace-zero subgroups of elliptic curves over a degree three field extension. The elements of these groups can be represented in compressed coordinates, i.e. via the two coefficients of the line that passes through the point and its two Frobenius conjugates. In this paper we give the first algorithm to compute scalar multiplication in the degree three trace-zero subgroup using these coordinates.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04178
On the Accuracy of Formal Verification of Selective Defenses for TDoS Attacks;Marcilio O. O. Lemos, Yuri Gil Dantas, Iguatemi E. Fonseca, Vivek Nigam;Telephony Denial of Service (TDoS) attacks target telephony services, such as Voice over IP (VoIP), not allowing legitimate users to make calls. There are few defenses that attempt to mitigate TDoS attacks, most of them using IP filtering, with limited applicability. In our previous work, we proposed to use selective strategies for mitigating HTTP Application-Layer DDoS Attacks demonstrating their effectiveness in mitigating different types of attacks. Developing such types of defenses is challenging as there are many design options, eg, which dropping functions and selection algorithms to use. Our first contribution is to demonstrate both experimentally and by using formal verification that selective strategies are suitable for mitigating TDoS attacks. We used our formal model to help decide which selective strategies to use with much less effort than carrying out experiments. Our second contribution is a detailed comparison of the results obtained from our formal models and the results obtained by carrying out experiments. We demonstrate that formal methods is a powerful tool for specifying defenses for mitigating Distributed Denial of Service attacks allowing to increase our confidence on the proposed defense before actual implementation.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04162
Models and Framework for Adversarial Attacks on Complex Adaptive Systems;Vahid Behzadan, Arslan Munir;We introduce the paradigm of adversarial attacks that target the dynamics of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS). To facilitate the analysis of such attacks, we present multiple approaches to the modeling of CAS as dynamical, data-driven, and game-theoretic systems, and develop quantitative definitions of attack, vulnerability, and resilience in the context of CAS security. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive set of schemes for classification of attacks and attack surfaces in CAS, complemented with examples of practical attacks. Building on this foundation, we propose a framework based on reinforcement learning for simulation and analysis of attacks on CAS, and demonstrate its performance through three real-world case studies of targeting power grids, destabilization of terrorist organizations, and manipulation of machine learning agents. We also discuss potential mitigation techniques, and remark on future research directions in analysis and design of secure complex adaptive systems.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04137
HitFraud: A Broad Learning Approach for Collective Fraud Detection in Heterogeneous Information Networks;Bokai Cao, Mia Mao, Siim Viidu, Philip S. Yu;On electronic game platforms, different payment transactions have different levels of risk. Risk is generally higher for digital goods in e-commerce. However, it differs based on product and its popularity, the offer type (packaged game, virtual currency to a game or subscription service), storefront and geography. Existing fraud policies and models make decisions independently for each transaction based on transaction attributes, payment velocities, user characteristics, and other relevant information. However, suspicious transactions may still evade detection and hence we propose a broad learning approach leveraging a graph based perspective to uncover relationships among suspicious transactions, i.e., inter-transaction dependency. Our focus is to detect suspicious transactions by capturing common fraudulent behaviors that would not be considered suspicious when being considered in isolation. In this paper, we present HitFraud that leverages heterogeneous information networks for collective fraud detection by exploring correlated and fast evolving fraudulent behaviors. First, a heterogeneous information network is designed to link entities of interest in the transaction database via different semantics. Then, graph based features are efficiently discovered from the network exploiting the concept of meta-paths, and decisions on frauds are made collectively on test instances. Experiments on real-world payment transaction data from Electronic Arts demonstrate that the prediction performance is effectively boosted by HitFraud with fast convergence where the computation of meta-path based features is largely optimized. Notably, recall can be improved up to 7.93% and F-score 4.62% compared to baselines.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04129
EAD: Elastic-Net Attacks to Deep Neural Networks via Adversarial Examples;Pin-Yu Chen, Yash Sharma, Huan Zhang, Jinfeng Yi, Cho-Jui Hsieh;Recent studies have highlighted the vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial examples - a visually indistinguishable adversarial image can easily be crafted to cause a well-trained model to misclassify.

Privacy Risk Assessment: From Art to Science, By Metrics;Isabel Wagner, Eerke Boiten;"Privacy risk assessments aim to analyze and quantify the privacy risks associated with new systems. As such, they are critically important in ensuring that adequate privacy protections for individual users are built in. However, current methods to quantify privacy risk rely heavily on experienced analysts who pick the ""correct"" risk level on a five-point scale. In this paper, we argue that a more scientific quantification of privacy risk increases accuracy and reliability and can thus make it easier to build privacy-friendly systems. We discuss how the impact and likelihood of privacy violations can be quantified and stress the importance of meaningful units of measurement. Finally, we argue that privacy risk metrics should be expressed as distributions instead of average values.";https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03776
MeshCloak: A Map-Based Approach for Personalized Location Privacy;Hiep H. Nguyen;Protecting location privacy in mobile services has recently received significant consideration as Location-Based Service (LBS) can reveal user locations to attackers. A problem in the existing cloaking schemes is that location vulnerabilities may be exposed when an attacker exploits a street map in their attacks. While both real and synthetic trajectories are based on real street maps, most of previous cloaking schemes assume free space movements to define the distance between users, resulting in the mismatch between privacy models and user movements. In this paper, we present MeshCloak, a novel map-based model for personalized location privacy, which is formulated entirely in map-based setting and resists inference attacks at a minimal performance overhead. The key idea of MeshCloak is to quickly build a sparse constraint graph based on the mutual coverage relationship between queries by pre-computing the distance matrix and applying quadtree search. MeshCloak also takes into account real speed profiles and query frequencies. We evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed scheme via a suite of carefully designed experiments on five real maps.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03642
A certified reference validation mechanism for the permission model of Android;Gustavo Betarte, Juan Campo, Felipe Gorostiaga, Carlos Luna;Android embodies security mechanisms at both OS and application level. In this platform application security is built primarily upon a system of permissions which specify restrictions on the operations a particular process can perform. The critical role of these security mechanisms makes them a prime target for (formal) verification. We present an idealized model of a reference monitor of the novel mechanisms of Android 6 (and further), where it is possible to grant permissions at run time. Using the programming language of the proof-assistant Coq we have developed a functional implementation of the reference validation mechanism and certified its correctness with respect to the specified reference monitor. Several properties concerning the permission model of Android 6 and its security mechanisms have been formally formulated and proved. Applying the program extraction mechanism provided by Coq we have also derived a certified Haskell prototype of the reference validation mechanism.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03652
Secure and Trustable Distributed Aggregation based on Kademlia;Stéphane Grumbach (DICE), Robert Riemann (DICE);Aggregation of values that need to be kept confidential while guaranteeing the robustness of the process and the correctness of the result is required in an increasing number of applications. We propose an aggregation algorithm, which supports a large spectrum of potential applications including complex voting protocols. It relies on the distributed hash table Kademlia, used in BitTorrent, for pseudonymous communication between randomly predetermined peers to ensure a high degree of confidentiality which does not solely relies on cryptography. The distribution of data and computation limits the potential for data breaches, and reduces the need for institutional trust. Experimental results confirm the complexity of O(n) for n peers allowing for large-scale applications.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03265
TestREx: a Framework for Repeatable Exploits;Stanislav Dashevskyi, Daniel Ricardo dos Santos, Fabio Massacci, Antonino Sabetta;Web applications are the target of many well known exploits and also a fertile ground for the discovery of security vulnerabilities. Yet, the success of an exploit depends both on the vulnerability in the application source code and the environment in which the application is deployed and run. As execution environments are complex (application servers, databases and other supporting applications), we need to have a reliable framework to test whether known exploits can be reproduced in different settings, better understand their effects, and facilitate the discovery of new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present TestREx - a framework that allows for highly automated, easily repeatable exploit testing in a variety of contexts, so that a security tester may quickly and efficiently perform large-scale experiments with vulnerability exploits. It supports packing and running applications with their environments, injecting exploits, monitoring their success, and generating security reports. We also provide a corpus of example applications, taken from related works or implemented by us.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03084
Defend against advanced persistent threats: An optimal control approach;Pengdeng Li, Lu-Xing Yang, Xiaofan Yang, Qingyu Xiong, Junhao Wen, Yuan Yan Tang;The new cyber attack pattern of advanced persistent threats (APTs) poses a serious threat to cyberspace. This paper addresses the issue of defending against APTs in a cost-effective way. First, the APT-based cyber attack-defense processes are modeled as a type of differential dynamical systems. Then, the cyber defense problem is modeled as an optimal control problem. The optimal control problem is shown to have an optimal control, and the optimality system for the problem is presented. Therefore, a cost-effective cyber defense strategy can be figured out by solving the optimality system. Finally, the influences of some factors, including the bounds on the admissible controls and the network topology, on the cost-effective defense strategies are examined. To our knowledge, this is the first time the APT-based cyber defense problem is treated this way.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02891
A Planning Approach to Monitoring Behavior of Computer Programs;Alexandre Cukier, Ronen I. Brafman, Yotam Perkal, David Tolpin;We describe a novel approach to monitoring high level behaviors using concepts from AI planning. Our goal is to understand what a program is doing based on its system call trace. This ability is particularly important for detecting malware. We approach this problem by building an abstract model of the operating system using the STRIPS planning language, casting system calls as planning operators. Given a system call trace, we simulate the corresponding operators on our model and by observing the properties of the state reached, we learn about the nature of the original program and its behavior. Thus, unlike most statistical detection methods that focus on syntactic features, our approach is semantic in nature. Therefore, it is more robust against obfuscation techniques used by malware that change the outward appearance of the trace but not its effect. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by evaluating it on actual system call traces.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03363
