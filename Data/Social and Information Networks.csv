On Early-stage Debunking Rumors on Twitter: Leveraging the Wisdom of Weak Learners;Tu Ngoc Nguyen, Cheng Li, Claudia Niederée;Recently a lot of progress has been made in rumor modeling and rumor detection for micro-blogging streams. However, existing automated methods do not perform very well for early rumor detection, which is crucial in many settings, e.g., in crisis situations. One reason for this is that aggregated rumor features such as propagation features, which work well on the long run, are - due to their accumulating characteristic - not very helpful in the early phase of a rumor. In this work, we present an approach for early rumor detection, which leverages Convolutional Neural Networks for learning the hidden representations of individual rumor-related tweets to gain insights on the credibility of each tweets. We then aggregate the predictions from the very beginning of a rumor to obtain the overall event credits (so-called wisdom), and finally combine it with a time series based rumor classification model. Our extensive experiments show a clearly improved classification performance within the critical very first hours of a rumor. For a better understanding, we also conduct an extensive feature evaluation that emphasized on the early stage and shows that the low-level credibility has best predictability at all phases of the rumor lifetime.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04402;
Approximate Integration of streaming data;Michel de Rougemont, Guillaume Vimont;We approximate analytic queries on streaming data with a weighted reservoir sampling. For a stream of tuples of a Datawarehouse we show how to approximate some OLAP queries. For a stream of graph edges from a Social Network, we approximate the communities as the large connected components of the edges in the reservoir. We show that for a model of random graphs which follow a power law degree distribution, the community detection algorithm is a good approximation. Given two streams of graph edges from two Sources, we define the {\em Community Correlation} as the fraction of the nodes in communities in both streams. Although we do not store the edges of the streams, we can approximate the Community Correlation and define the {\em Integration of two streams}. We illustrate this approach with Twitter streams, associated with TV programs.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04290;
Mitigating Overexposure in Viral Marketing;Rediet Abebe, Lada Adamic, Jon Kleinberg;In traditional models for word-of-mouth recommendations and viral marketing, the objective function has generally been based on reaching as many people as possible. However, a number of studies have shown that the indiscriminate spread of a product by word-of-mouth can result in overexposure, reaching people who evaluate it negatively. This can lead to an effect in which the over-promotion of a product can produce negative reputational effects, by reaching a part of the audience that is not receptive to it.;;
How should one make use of social influence when there is a risk of overexposure?; we show how it captures a number of the qualitative phenomena associated with overexposure, and for the main formulation of our model, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to find the optimal marketing strategy. We also present simulations of the model on real network topologies, quantifying the extent to which our optimal strategies outperform natural baselines;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04123;;
Local Community Detection in Dynamic Networks;Daniel J. DiTursi, Gaurav Ghosh, Petko Bogdanov;"Given a time-evolving network, how can we detect communities over periods of high internal and low external interactions? To address this question we generalize traditional local community detection in graphs to the setting of dynamic networks. Adopting existing static-network approaches in an ""aggregated"" graph of all temporal interactions is not appropriate for the problem as dynamic communities may be short-lived and thus lost when mixing interactions over long periods. Hence, dynamic community mining requires the detection of both the community nodes and an optimal time interval in which they are actively interacting.";;
Network Clocks: Detecting the Temporal Scale of Information Diffusion;Daniel J. DiTursi, Gregorios A. Katsios, Petko Bogdanov;Information diffusion models typically assume a discrete timeline in which an information token spreads in the network. Since users in real-world networks vary significantly in their intensity and periods of activity, our objective in this work is to answer: How to determine a temporal scale that best agrees with the observed information propagation within a network? A key limitation of existing approaches is that they aggregate the timeline into fixed-size windows, which may not fit all network nodes' activity periods. We propose the notion of a heterogeneous network clock: a mapping of events to discrete timestamps that best explains their occurrence according to a given cascade propagation model. We focus on the widely-adopted independent cascade (IC) model and formalize the optimal clock as the one that maximizes the likelihood of all observed cascades. The single optimal clock (OC) problem can be solved exactly in polynomial time. However, we prove that learning multiple optimal clocks(kOC), corresponding to temporal patterns of groups of network nodes, is NP-hard. We propose scalable solutions that run in almost linear time in the total number of cascade activations and discuss approximation guarantees for each variant. Our algorithms and their detected clocks enable improved cascade size classification (up to 8 percent F1 lift) and improved missing cascade data inference (0.15 better recall). We also demonstrate that the network clocks exhibit consistency within the type of content diffusing in the network and are robust with respect to the propagation probability parameters of the IC model.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04015;

Forbidden triads and Creative Success in Jazz: The Miles Davis Factor;Balazs Vedres;This article argues for the importance of forbidden triads - open triads with high-weight edges - in predicting success in creative fields. Forbidden triads had been treated as a residual category beyond closed and open triads, yet I argue that these structures provide opportunities to combine socially evolved styles in new ways. Using data on the entire history of recorded jazz from 1896 to 2010, I show that observed collaborations have tolerated the openness of high weight triads more than expected, observed jazz sessions had more forbidden triads than expected, and the density of forbidden triads contributed to the success of recording sessions, measured by the number of record releases of session material. The article also shows that the sessions of Miles Davis had received an especially high boost from forbidden triads.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03787;
Establishing Personal Trust-based Connections in Distributed Teams;Fabio Calefato, Filippo Lanubile;Trust is a factor that dramatically contributes to the success or failure of distributed software teams. We present a research model showing that social communication between distant developers enables the affective appraisal of trustworthiness even from a distance, thus increasing project performance. To overcome the limitations of self-reported data, typically questionnaires, we focus on software projects following a pull request-based development model and approximate the overall performance of a software project with the history of successful collaborations occurring between developers.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03777;
Principled Multilayer Network Embedding;Weiyi Liu, Sailung Yeung, Pin-Yu Chen, Toyotaro Suzumura, Lingli Chen;"Multilayer network analysis has become a vital tool for understanding different relationships and their interactions in a complex system, where each layer in a multilayer network depicts the topological structure of a group of nodes corresponding to a particular relationship. The interactions among different layers imply how the interplay of different relations on the topology of each layer. For a single-layer network, network embedding methods have been proposed to project the nodes in a network into a continuous vector space with a relatively small number of dimensions, where the space embeds the social representations among nodes. These algorithms have been proved to have a better performance on a variety of regular graph analysis tasks, such as link prediction, or multi-label classification. In this paper, by extending a standard graph mining into multilayer network, we have proposed three methods (""network aggregation,"" ""results aggregation"" and ""layer co-analysis"") to project a multilayer network into a continuous vector space. From the evaluation, we have proved that comparing with regular link prediction methods, ""layer co-analysis"" achieved the best performance on most of the datasets, while ""network aggregation"" and ""results aggregation"" also have better performance than regular link prediction methods.";https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03551;
Learning Graph Topological Features via GAN;Weiyi Liu, Hal Cooper, Min Hwan Oh, Sailung Yeung, Pin-yu Chen, Toyotaro Suzumura, Lingli Chen;Inspired by the generation power of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in image domains, we introduce a novel hierarchical architecture for learning characteristic topological features from a single arbitrary input graph via GANs. The hierarchical architecture consisting of multiple GANs preserves both local and global topological features and automatically partitions the input graph into representative stages for feature learning. The stages facilitate reconstruction and can be used as indicators of the importance of the associated topological structures. Experiments show that our method produces subgraphs retaining a wide range of topological features, even in early reconstruction stages (unlike a single GAN, which cannot easily identify such features, let alone reconstruct the original graph). This paper is firstline research on combining the use of GANs and graph topological analysis.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03545;
Reconstruction of multiplex networks with correlated layers;Valerio Gemmetto, Diego Garlaschelli;The characterization of various properties of real-world systems requires the knowledge of the underlying network of connections among the system's components. Unfortunately, in many situations the complete topology of this network is empirically inaccessible, and one has to resort to probabilistic techniques to infer it from limited information. While network reconstruction methods have reached some degree of maturity in the case of single-layer networks (where nodes can be connected only by one type of links), the problem is practically unexplored in the case of multiplex networks, where several interdependent layers, each with a different type of links, coexist. Even the most advanced network reconstruction techniques, if applied to each layer separately, fail in replicating the observed inter-layer dependencies making up the whole coupled multiplex. Here we develop a methodology to reconstruct a class of correlated multiplexes which includes the World Trade Multiplex as a specific example we study in detail. Our method starts from any reconstruction model that successfully reproduces some desired marginal properties, including node strengths and/or node degrees, of each layer separately. It then introduces the minimal dependency structure required to replicate an additional set of higher-order properties that quantify the portion of each node's degree and each node's strength that is shared and/or reciprocated across pairs of layers. These properties are found to provide empirically robust measures of inter-layer coupling. Our method allows joint multi-layer connection probabilities to be reliably reconstructed from marginal ones, effectively bridging the gap between single-layer properties and truly multiplex information.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03918;
Distributed Estimation Recovery under Sensor Failure;Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian, Hamid R. Rabiee, Houman Zarrabi, Usman A. Khan;Single time-scale distributed estimation of dynamic systems via a network of sensors/estimators is addressed in this letter. In single time-scale distributed estimation, the two fusion steps, consensus and measurement exchange, are implemented only once, in contrast to, e.g., a large number of consensus iterations at every step of the system dynamics. We particularly discuss the problem of failure in the sensor/estimator network and how to recover for distributed estimation by adding new sensor measurements from equivalent states. We separately discuss the recovery for two types of sensors, namely \alpha and \beta sensors. We propose polynomial order algorithms to find equivalent state nodes in graph representation of system to recover for distributed observability. The polynomial order solution is particularly significant for large-scale systems.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03855;
Observational Equivalence in System Estimation: Contractions in Complex Networks;Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian, Hamid R. Rabiee, Houman Zarrabi, Usman Khan;Observability of complex systems/networks is the focus of this paper, which is shown to be closely related to the concept of contraction. Indeed, for observable network tracking it is necessary/sufficient to have one node in each contraction measured. Therefore, nodes in a contraction are equivalent to recover for loss of observability, implying that contraction size is a key factor for observability recovery. Here, using a polynomial order contraction detection algorithm, we analyze the distribution of contractions, studying its relation with key network properties. Our results show that contraction size is related to network clustering coefficient and degree heterogeneity. Particularly, in networks with power-law degree distribution, if the clustering coefficient is high there are less contractions with smaller size on average. The implication is that estimation/tracking of such systems requires less number of measurements, while their observational recovery is more restrictive in case of sensor failure. Further, in Small-World networks higher degree heterogeneity implies that there are more contractions with smaller size on average. Therefore, the estimation of representing system requires more measurements, and also the recovery of measurement failure is more limited. These results imply that one can tune the properties of synthetic networks to alleviate their estimation/observability recovery.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03846;
Coin-flipping, ball-dropping, and grass-hopping for generating random graphs from matrices of edge probabilities;Arjun S. Ramani, Nicole Eikmeier, David F. Gleich;Common models for random graphs, such as Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi and Kronecker graphs, correspond to generating random adjacency matrices where each entry is non-zero based on a large matrix of probabilities. Generating an instance of a random graph based on these models is easy, although inefficient, by flipping biased coins (i.e. sampling binomial random variables) for each possible edge. This process is inefficient because most large graph models correspond to sparse graphs where the vast majority of coin flips will result in no edges. We describe some not-entirely-well-known, but not-entirely-unknown, techniques that will enable us to sample a graph by finding only the coin flips that will produce edges. Our analogies for these procedures are ball-dropping, which is easier to implement, but may need extra work due to duplicate edges, and grass-hopping, which results in no duplicated work or extra edges.;;

A Multilayer and Time-varying Structural Analysis of the Brazilian Air Transportation Network;Bernardo Costa, João Victor Bechara, Klaus Wehmuth, Artur Ziviani;This paper provides a multilayer and time-varying structural analysis of one air transportation network, having the Brazilian air transportation network as a case study. Using a single mathematical object called MultiAspect Graph (MAG) for this analysis, the multilayer perspective enables the unveiling of the particular strategies of each airline to both establish and adapt in a moment of crisis its specific flight network. Similarly, the time-varying perspective allows multi-scale analysis considering different time periods, and thus assessing the impact of the economic crisis on how the different airlines establish their routes as well as the flights that use these routes. Altogether, besides the multilayer and time-varying structural analysis of the Brazilian air transportation network, this paper also acts as a proof-of-concept for the MAG potential for the modeling and analysis of high-order networks.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03360;
Local Edge Betweenness based Label Propagation for Community Detection in Complex Networks;Hamid Shahrivari, Alireza Bagheri;Nowadays, identification and detection community structures in complex networks is an important factor in extracting useful information from networks. Label propagation algorithm with near linear-time complexity is one of the most popular methods for detecting community structures, yet its uncertainty and randomness is a defective factor. Merging LPA with other community detection metrics would improve its accuracy and reduce instability of LPA. Considering this point, in this paper we tried to use edge betweenness centrality to improve LPA performance. On the other hand, calculating edge betweenness centrality is expensive, so as an alternative metric, we try to use local edge betweenness and present LPA-LEB (Label Propagation Algorithm Local Edge Betweenness). Experimental results on both real-world and benchmark networks show that LPA-LEB possesses higher accuracy and stability than LPA when detecting community structures in networks.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03135;
Robustness of Interdependent Random Geometric Networks;Jianan Zhang, Edmund Yeh, Eytan Modiano;We propose an interdependent random geometric graph (RGG) model for interdependent networks. Based on this model, we study the robustness of two interdependent spatially embedded networks where interdependence exists between geographically nearby nodes in the two networks. We study the emergence of the giant mutual component in two interdependent RGGs as node densities increase, and define the percolation threshold as a pair of node densities above which the giant mutual component first appears. In contrast to the case for a single RGG, where the percolation threshold is a unique scalar for a given connection distance, for two interdependent RGGs, multiple pairs of percolation thresholds may exist, given that a smaller node density in one RGG may increase the minimum node density in the other RGG in order for a giant mutual component to exist. We derive analytical upper bounds on the percolation thresholds of two interdependent RGGs by discretization, and obtain;;
Tabloids in the Era of Social Media? Understanding the Production and Consumption of Clickbaits in Twitter;Abhijnan Chakraborty, Rajdeep Sarkar, Ayushi Mrigen, Niloy Ganguly;With the growing shift towards news consumption primarily through social media sites like Twitter, most of the traditional as well as new-age media houses are promoting their news stories by tweeting about them. The competition for user attention in such mediums has led many media houses to use catchy sensational form of tweets to attract more users - a process known as clickbaiting. In this work, using an extensive dataset collected from Twitter, we analyze the social sharing patterns of clickbait and non-clickbait tweets to determine the organic reach of such tweets. We also attempt to study the sections of Twitter users who actively engage themselves in following clickbait and non-clickbait tweets. Comparing the advent of clickbaits with the rise of tabloidization of news, we bring out several important insights regarding the news consumers as well as the media organizations promoting news stories on Twitter.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02957;

Connectivity in Interdependent Networks;Jianan Zhang, Eytan Modiano;We propose and analyze a graph model to study the connectivity of interdependent networks.

Such interdependence arises in cyber-physical systems and layered network architectures.;;
Fractional Dynamics of Network Growth Constrained by aging Node Interactions;Hadiseh Safdari, Milad Zare Kamali, Amirhossein Shirazi, Moein Khalighi, Gholamreza Jafari, Marcel Ausloos;"In many social complex systems, in which agents are linked by non-linear interactions, the history of events strongly influences the whole network dynamics. However, a class of ""commonly accepted beliefs"" seems rarely studied. In this paper, we examine how the growth process of a (social) network is influenced by past circumstances. In order to tackle this cause, we simply modify the well known preferential attachment mechanism by imposing a time dependent kernel function in the network evolution equation. This approach leads to a fractional order Barabasi-Albert (BA) differential equation, generalizing the BA model. Our results show that, with passing time, an aging process is observed for the network dynamics. The aging process leads to a decay for the node degree values, thereby creating an opposing process to the preferential attachment mechanism. On one hand, based on the preferential attachment mechanism, nodes with a high degree are more likely to absorb links"; but, on the other hand, a node's age has a reduced chance for new connections. This competitive scenario allows an increased chance for younger members to become a hub. Simulations of such a network growth with aging constraint confirm the results found from solving the fractional BA equation. We also report, as an exemplary application, an investigation of the collaboration network between Hollywood movie actors. It is undubiously shown that a decay in the dynamics of their collaboration rate is found, - even including a sex difference. Such findings suggest a widely universal application of the so generalized BA model.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02960
Glassy states of aging social networks;F. Hassanibesheli, L. Hedayatifar, H. Safdari, M. Ausloos, G. R. Jafari;"Individuals often develop reluctance to change their social relations, called ""secondary homebody"", even though their interactions with their environment evolve with time. Some memory effect is loosely present deforcing changes. In other words, in presence of memory, relations do not change easily. In order to investigate some history or memory effect on social networks, we introduce a temporal kernel function into the Heider conventional balance theory, allowing for the ""quality"" of past relations to contribute to the evolution of the system. This memory effect is shown to lead to the emergence of aged networks, thereby perfectly describing and the more so measuring the aging process of links (""social relations""). It is shown that such a memory does not change the dynamical attractors of the system, but does prolong the time necessary to reach the ""balanced states"". The general trend goes toward obtaining either global (""paradise"" or ""bipolar"") or local (""jammed"") balanced states, but is profoundly affected by aged relations. The resistance of elder links against changes decelerates the evolution of the system and traps it into so named glassy states. In contrast to balance";https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02951;
