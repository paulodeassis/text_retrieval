Neural Network Based Nonlinear Weighted Finite Automata;Tianyu Li, Guillaume Rabusseau, Doina Precup;Weighted finite automata (WFA) can expressively model functions defined over strings. However, a WFA is inherently a linear model. In this paper, we propose a neural network based nonlinear WFA model along with a learning algorithm. Our learning algorithm performs a nonlinear decomposition of the so-called Hankel matrix (using an encode decoder neural network) from which the transition operators of the model are recovered. We assessed the performance of the proposed model in a simulation study.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04380
Finite-state Strategies in Delay Games;Martin Zimmermann (Saarland University);What is a finite-state strategy in a delay game? We answer this surprisingly non-trivial question and present a very general framework for computing such strategies: they exist for all winning conditions that are recognized by automata with acceptance conditions that satisfy a certain aggregation property. Our framework also yields upper bounds on the complexity of determining the winner of such delay games and upper bounds on the necessary lookahead to win the game. In particular, we cover all previous results of that kind as special cases of our uniform approach.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03539
Verification of Asynchronous Systems with an Unspecified Component;Rosa Abbasi, Fatemeh Ghassemi, Ramtin Khosravi;Component-based systems evolve as a new component is added or an existing one is replaced by a newer version. Hence, it is appealing to assure the new system still preserves its safety properties. However, instead of inspecting the new system as a whole, which may result in a large state space, it is beneficial to reuse the verification results by inspecting the newly added component in isolation. To this aim, we study the problem of model checking component-based asynchronously communicating systems in the presence of an unspecified component against safety properties. Our solution is based on assume-guarantee reasoning, adopted for asynchronous environments, which generates the weakest assumption. If the newly added component conforms to the assumption, then the whole system still satisfies the property. To make the approach efficient and convergent, we produce an overapproximated interface of the missing component and by its composition with the rest of the system components, we achieve an overapproximated specification of the system, from which we remove those traces of the system that violate the property and generate an assumption for the missing component.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03245
Two Recursively Inseparable Problems for Probabilistic Automata;Nathanaël Fijalkow, Hugo Gimbert, Florian Horn, Youssouf Oualhadj;This paper introduces and investigates decision problems for numberless probabilistic automata, i.e. probabilistic automata where the support of each probabilistic transitions is specified, but the exact values of the probabilities are not. A numberless probabilistic automaton can be instantiated into a probabilistic automaton by specifying the exact values of the non-zero probabilistic transitions.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03122
Trading Bounds for Memory in Games with Counters;Nathanaël Fijalkow, Florian Horn, Denis Kuperberg, Micha? Skrzypczak;We study two-player games with counters, where the objective of the first player is that the counter values remain bounded. We investigate the existence of a trade-off between the size of the memory and the bound achieved on the counters, which has been conjectured by Colcombet and Loeding.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03121
Automata as p-adic Dynamical Systems;Livat Tyapaev;The automaton transformation of infinite words over alphabet Fp={0,1,…,p?1}, where p is a prime number, coincide with the continuous transformation (with respect to the p-adic metric) of a ring Zp of p-adic integers. The objects of the study are non-Archimedean dynamical systems generated by automata mappings on the space Zp. Measure-preservation (with the respect to the Haar measure) and ergodicity of such dynamical systems plays an important role in cryptography (e.g. for pseudorandom generators and stream cyphers design). The possibility to use p-adic methods and geometrical images of automata allows to characterize of a transitive (or, ergodic) automata. We investigate a measure-preserving and ergodic mappings associated with synchronous and asynchronous automata. We have got criterion of measure-preservation for an n-unit delay mappings associated with asynchronous automata. Moreover, we have got a sufficient condition of ergodicity of such mappings.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02644
Closure Properties in the Class of Multiple Context Free Groups;Robert P. Kropholler, Davide Spriano;We show that the class of groups with k-multiple context free word problem is closed under amalgamated free products over finite subgroups. We also show that the intersection of two context free languages need not be multiple context free.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02478
Sequential Composition in the Presence of Intermediate Termination (Extended Abstract);Jos Baeten (CWI and University of Amsterdam), Bas Luttik (Eindhoven University of Technology), Fei Yang (Eindhoven University of Technology);The standard operational semantics of the sequential composition operator gives rise to unbounded branching and forgetfulness when transparent process expressions are put in sequence. Due to transparency, the correspondence between context-free and pushdown processes fails modulo bisimilarity, and it is not clear how to specify an always terminating half counter. We propose a revised operational semantics for the sequential composition operator in the context of intermediate termination. With the revised operational semantics, we eliminate transparency, allowing us to establish a close correspondence between context-free processes and pushdown processes. Moreover, we prove the reactive Turing powerfulness of TCP with iteration and nesting with the revised operational semantics for sequential composition.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02440
LTL to Deterministic Emerson-Lei Automata;David Müller (Technische Universität Dresden), Salomon Sickert (Technische Universität München);We introduce a new translation from linear temporal logic (LTL) to deterministic Emerson-Lei automata, which are omega-automata with a Muller acceptance condition symbolically expressed as a Boolean formula. The richer acceptance condition structure allows the shift of complexity from the state space to the acceptance condition. Conceptually the construction is an enhanced product construction that exploits knowledge of its components to reduce the number of states. We identify two fragments of LTL, for which one can easily construct deterministic automata and show how knowledge of these components can reduce the number of states. We extend this idea to a general LTL framework, where we can use arbitrary LTL to deterministic automata translators for parts of formulas outside the mentioned fragments. Further, we show succinctness of the translation compared to existing construction. The construction is implemented in the tool Delag, which we evaluate on several benchmarks of LTL formulas and probabilistic model checking case studies.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02102
MK-fuzzy Automata and MSO Logics;Manfred Droste (University of Leipzig), Temur Kutsia (RISC), George Rahonis (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki), Wolfgang Schreiner (RISC);"We introduce MK-fuzzy automata over a bimonoid K which is related to the fuzzification of the McCarthy-Kleene logic. Our automata are inspired by, and intend to contribute to, practical applications being in development in a project on runtime network monitoring based on predicate logic. We investigate closure properties of the class of recognizable MK-fuzzy languages accepted by MK-fuzzy automata as well as of deterministically recognizable MK-fuzzy languages accepted by their deterministic counterparts. Moreover, we establish a Nivat-like result for recognizable MK-fuzzy languages. We introduce an MK-fuzzy MSO logic and show the expressive equivalence of a fragment of this logic with MK-fuzzy automata, i.e., a B\""uchi type theorem.";https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02098
T-regular Expressions and Counter-Check Automata;"Dario Della Monica (Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain, and Università ""Federico II"" di Napoli, Italy), Angelo Montanari (Università di Udine, Italy), Pietro Sala (Università di Verona)";In the last years, various extensions of {\omega}-regular languages have been proposed in the literature, including {\omega}B-regular ({\omega}-regular languages extended with boundedness), {\omega}S-regular ({\omega}-regular languages extended with strict unboundedness), and {\omega}BS-regular languages (the combination of {\omega}B- and {\omega}S-regular ones). While the first two classes satisfy a generalized closure property, namely, the complement of an {\omega}B-regular (resp., {\omega}S-regular) language is an {\omega}S-regular (resp., {\omega}B-regular) one, the last class is not closed under complementation. The existence of non-{\omega}BS-regular languages that are the complements of some {\omega}BS-regular ones and express fairly natural properties of reactive systems motivates the search for other well-behaved classes of extended {\omega}-regular languages. In this paper, we introduce the class of {\omega}T-regular languages, that includes meaningful languages which are not {\omega}BS-regular. We first define it in terms of {\omega}T-regular expressions. Then, we introduce a new class of automata (counter-check automata) and we prove that (i) their emptiness problem is decidable in PTIME and (ii) they are expressive enough to capture {\omega}T-regular languages (whether or not {\omega}T-regular languages are expressively complete with respect to counter-check automata is still an open problem). Finally, we provide an encoding of {\omega}T-regular expressions into S1S+U.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02104
Probabilistic Analysis Based On Symbolic Game Semantics and Model Counting;Aleksandar S. Dimovski (IT University of Copenhagen);Probabilistic program analysis aims to quantify the probability that a given program satisfies a required property. It has many potential applications, from program understanding and debugging to computing program reliability, compiler optimizations and quantitative information flow analysis for security. In these situations, it is usually more relevant to quantify the probability of satisfying/violating a given property than to just assess the possibility of such events to occur.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02092
