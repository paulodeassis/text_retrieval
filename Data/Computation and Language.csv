Affective Neural Response Generation;;Nabiha Asghar, Pascal Poupart, Jesse Hoey, Xin Jiang, Lili Mou;;Existing neural conversational models process natural language primarily on a lexico-syntactic level, thereby ignoring one of the most crucial components of human-to-human dialogue: its affective content. We take a step in this direction by proposing three novel ways to incorporate affective/emotional aspects into long short term memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder neural conversation models: (1) affective word embeddings, which are cognitively engineered, (2) affect-based objective functions that augment the standard cross-entropy loss, and (3) affectively diverse beam search for decoding. Experiments show that these techniques improve the open-domain conversational prowess of encoder-decoder networks by enabling them to produce emotionally rich responses that are more interesting and natural.;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03968
Hash Embeddings for Efficient Word Representations;;Dan Svenstrup, Jonas Meinertz Hansen, Ole Winther;;We present hash embeddings, an efficient method for representing words in a continuous vector form. A hash embedding may be seen as an interpolation between a standard word embedding and a word embedding created using a random hash function (the hashing trick). In hash embeddings each token is represented by k d-dimensional embeddings vectors and one k dimensional weight vector. The final d dimensional representation of the token is the product of the two. Rather than fitting the embedding vectors for each token these are selected by the hashing trick from a shared pool of B embedding vectors. Our experiments show that hash embeddings can easily deal with huge vocabularies consisting of millions of tokens. When using a hash embedding there is no need to create a dictionary before training nor to perform any kind of vocabulary pruning after training. We show that models trained using hash embeddings exhibit at least the same level of performance as models trained using regular embeddings across a wide range of tasks. Furthermore, the number of parameters needed by such an embedding is only a fraction of what is required by a regular embedding. Since standard embeddings and embeddings constructed using the hashing trick are actually just special cases of a hash embedding, hash embeddings can be considered an extension and improvement over the existing regular embedding types.;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03933
Human Associations Help to Detect Conventionalized Multiword Expressions;;Natalia Loukachevitch, Anastasia Gerasimova;;In this paper we show that if we want to obtain human evidence about conventionalization of some phrases, we should ask native speakers about associations they have to a given phrase and its component words. We have shown that if component words of a phrase have each other as frequent associations, then this phrase can be considered as conventionalized. Another type of conventionalized phrases can be revealed using two factors: low entropy of phrase associations and low intersection of component word and phrase associations. The association experiments were performed for the Russian language.;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03925
StarSpace: Embed All The Things!;;Ledell Wu, Adam Fisch, Sumit Chopra, Keith Adams, Antoine Bordes, Jason Weston;;We present StarSpace, a general-purpose neural embedding model that can solve a wide variety of problems: labeling tasks such as text classification, ranking tasks such as information retrieval/web search, collaborative filtering-based or content-based recommendation, embedding of multi-relational graphs, and learning word, sentence or document level embeddings. In each case the model works by embedding those entities comprised of discrete features and comparing them against each other -- learning similarities dependent on the task. Empirical results on a number of tasks show that StarSpace is highly competitive with existing methods, whilst also being generally applicable to new cases where those methods are not.;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03856
OpenNMT: Open-source Toolkit for Neural Machine Translation;;Guillaume Klein, Yoon Kim, Yuntian Deng, Josep Crego, Jean Senellart, Alexander M.

Our systems are built using OpenNMT, an open-source neural machine translation system, implementing sequence-to-sequence models with LSTM encoder/decoders and attention. We experimented using monolingual data automatically back-translated. Our resulting models are further hyper-specialised with an adaptation technique that finely tunes models according to the evaluation test sentences.;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03814
Language Models of Spoken Dutch;;Lyan Verwimp, Joris Pelemans, Marieke Lycke, Hugo Van hamme, Patrick Wambacq;;In Flanders, all TV shows are subtitled. However, the process of subtitling is a very time-consuming one and can be sped up by providing the output of a speech recognizer run on the audio of the TV show, prior to the subtitling. Naturally, this speech recognition will perform much better if the employed language model is adapted to the register and the topic of the program. We present several language models trained on subtitles of television shows provided by the Flemish public-service broadcaster VRT. This data was gathered in the context of the project STON which has as purpose to facilitate the process of subtitling TV shows. One model is trained on all available data (46M word tokens), but we also trained models on a specific type of TV show or domain/topic. Language models of spoken language are quite rare due to the lack of training data. The size of this corpus is relatively large for a corpus of spoken language (compare with e.g. CGN which has 9M words), but still rather small for a language model. Thus, in practice it is advised to interpolate these models with a large background language model trained on written language. The models can be freely downloaded on this http URL;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03759
Cross-lingual Word Segmentation and Morpheme Segmentation as Sequence Labelling;;Yan Shao;;This paper presents our segmentation system developed for the MLP 2017 shared tasks on cross-lingual word segmentation and morpheme segmentation. We model both word and morpheme segmentation as character-level sequence labelling tasks. The prevalent bidirectional recurrent neural network with conditional random fields as the output interface is adapted as the baseline system, which is further improved via ensemble decoding. Our universal system is applied to and extensively evaluated on all the official data sets without any language-specific adjustment. The official evaluation results indicate that the proposed model achieves outstanding accuracies both for word and morpheme segmentation on all the languages in various types when compared to the other participating systems.;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03756
Small-footprint Keyword Spotting Using Deep Neural Network and Connectionist Temporal Classifier;;Zhiming Wang, Xiaolong Li, Jun Zhou;;Mainly for the sake of solving the lack of keyword-specific data, we propose one Keyword Spotting (KWS) system using Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Connectionist Temporal Classifier (CTC) on power-constrained small-footprint mobile devices, taking full advantage of general corpus from continuous speech recognition which is of great amount. DNN is to directly predict the posterior of phoneme units of any personally customized key-phrase, and CTC to produce a confidence score of the given phoneme sequence as responsive decision-making mechanism. The CTC-KWS has competitive performance in comparison with purely DNN based keyword specific KWS, but not increasing any computational complexity.;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03665
Capturing Long-range Contextual Dependencies with Memory-enhanced Conditional Random Fields;;Fei Liu, Timothy Baldwin, Trevor Cohn;;Despite successful applications across a broad range of NLP tasks, conditional random fields ("CRFs"), in particular the linear-chain variant, are only able to model local features. While this has important benefits in terms of inference tractability, it limits the ability of the model to capture long-range dependencies between items. Attempts to extend CRFs to capture long-range dependencies have largely come at the cost of computational complexity and approximate inference. In this work, we propose an extension to CRFs by integrating external memory, taking inspiration from memory networks, thereby allowing CRFs to incorporate information far beyond neighbouring steps. Experiments across two tasks show substantial improvements over strong CRF and LSTM baselines.;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03637
KnowNER: Incremental Multilingual Knowledge in Named Entity Recognition;;Dominic Seyler, Tatiana Dembelova, Luciano Del Corro, Johannes Hoffart, Gerhard Weikum;;KnowNER is a multilingual Named Entity Recognition (NER) system that leverages different degrees of external knowledge. A novel modular framework divides the knowledge into four categories according to the depth of knowledge they convey. Each category consists of a set of features automatically generated from different information sources (such as a knowledge-base, a list of names or document-specific semantic annotations) and is used to train a conditional random field (CRF). Since those information sources are usually multilingual, KnowNER can be easily trained for a wide range of languages. In this paper, we show that the incorporation of deeper knowledge systematically boosts accuracy and compare KnowNER with state-of-the-art NER approaches across three languages (i.e., English, German and Spanish) performing amongst state-of-the art systems in all of them.;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03544
Dependencies: Formalising Semantic Catenae for Information Retrieval;;Christina Lioma;;Building machines that can understand text like humans is an AI-complete problem. A great deal of research has already gone into this, with astounding results, allowing everyday people to discuss with their telephones, or have their reading materials analysed and classified by computers. A prerequisite for processing text semantics, common to the above examples, is having some computational representation of text as an abstract object. Operations on this representation practically correspond to making semantic inferences, and by extension simulating understanding text. The complexity and granularity of semantic processing that can be realised is constrained by the mathematical and computational robustness, expressiveness, and rigour of the tools used. This dissertation contributes a series of such tools, diverse in their mathematical formulation, but common in their application to model semantic inferences when machines process text. These tools are principally expressed in nine distinct models that capture aspects of semantic dependence in highly interpretable and non-complex ways. This dissertation further reflects on present and future problems with the current research paradigm in this area, and makes recommendations on how to overcome them. The amalgamation of the body of work presented in this dissertation advances the complexity and granularity of semantic inferences that can be made automatically by machines.;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03742
Data-Driven Dialogue Systems for Social Agents;;Kevin K. Bowden, Shereen Oraby, Amita Misra, Jiaqi Wu, Stephanie Lukin;;In order to build dialogue systems to tackle the ambitious task of holding social conversations, we argue that we need a data driven approach that includes insight into human conversational chit chat, and which incorporates different natural language processing modules. Our strategy is to analyze and index large corpora of social media data, including Twitter conversations, online debates, dialogues between friends, and blog posts, and then to couple this data retrieval with modules that perform tasks such as sentiment and style analysis, topic modeling, and summarization. We aim for personal assistants that can learn more nuanced human language, and to grow from task-oriented agents to more personable social bots.;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03190
Debbie, the Debate Bot of the Future;;Geetanjali Rakshit, Kevin K. Bowden, Lena Reed, Amita Misra, Marilyn Walker;;Chatbots are a rapidly expanding application of dialogue systems with companies switching to bot services for customer support, and new applications for users interested in casual conversation. One style of casual conversation is argument, many people love nothing more than a good argument. Moreover, there are a number of existing corpora of argumentative dialogues, annotated for agreement and disagreement, stance, sarcasm and argument quality. This paper introduces Debbie, a novel arguing bot, that selects arguments from conversational corpora, and aims to use them appropriately in context. We present an initial working prototype of Debbie, with some preliminary evaluation and describe future work.;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03167
AppTechMiner: Mining Applications and Techniques from Scientific Articles;;Sanyam Agarwal, Mayank Singh, Soham Dan, Pawan Goyal, Animesh Mukherjee;;This paper presents AppTechMiner, a rule-based information extraction framework that automatically constructs a knowledge base of all application areas and problem solving techniques. Techniques include tools, methods, datasets or evaluation metrics. We also categorize individual research articles based on their application areas and the techniques proposed/improved in the article. Our system achieves high average precision (~82%) and recall (~84%) in knowledge base creation. It also performs well in application and technique assignment to an individual article (average accuracy ~66%). In the end, we further present two use cases presenting a trivial information retrieval system and an extensive temporal analysis of the usage of techniques and application areas. At present, we demonstrate the framework for the domain of computational linguistics but this can be easily generalized to any other field of research.;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03064
Abductive Matching in Question Answering;;Kedar Dhamdhere, Kevin S. McCurley, Mukund Sundararajan, Ankur Taly;;We study question-answering over semi-structured data. We introduce a new way to apply the technique of semantic parsing by applying machine learning only to provide annotations that the system infers to be missing; all the other parsing logic is in the form of manually authored rules. In effect, the machine learning is used to provide non-syntactic matches, a step that is ill-suited to manual rules. The advantage of this approach is in its debuggability and in its transparency to the end-user. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by achieving state-of-the-art performance of 40.42% accuracy on a standard benchmark dataset over tables from Wikipedia.;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03036
Steering Output Style and Topic in Neural Response Generation;;Di Wang, Nebojsa Jojic, Chris Brockett, Eric Nyberg;;We propose simple and flexible training and decoding methods for influencing output style and topic in neural encoder-decoder based language generation. This capability is desirable in a variety of applications, including conversational systems, where successful agents need to produce language in a specific style and generate responses steered by a human puppeteer or external knowledge. We decompose the neural generation process into empirically easier sub-problems: a faithfulness model and a decoding method based on selective-sampling. We also describe training and sampling algorithms that bias the generation process with a specific language style restriction, or a topic restriction. Human evaluation results show that our proposed methods are able to restrict style and topic without degrading output quality in conversational tasks.;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03010
Semi-Supervised Instance Population of an Ontology using Word Vector Embeddings;;Vindula Jayawardana, Dimuthu Lakmal, Nisansa de Silva, Amal Shehan Perera, Keet Sugathadasa, Buddhi Ayesha, Madhavi Perera;;In many modern day systems such as information extraction and knowledge management agents, ontologies play a vital role in maintaining the concept hierarchies of the selected domain. However, ontology population has become a problematic process due to its nature of heavy coupling with manual human intervention. With the use of word embeddings in the field of natural language processing, it became a popular topic due to its ability to cope up with semantic sensitivity. Hence, in this study, we propose a novel way of semi-supervised ontology population through word embeddings as the basis. We built several models including traditional benchmark models and new types of models which are based on word embeddings. Finally, we ensemble them together to come up with a synergistic model with better accuracy. We demonstrate that our ensemble model can outperform the individual models.;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02911
CLaC at SemEval-2016 Task 11: Exploring linguistic and psycho-linguistic Features for Complex Word Identification;;Elnaz Davoodi, Leila Kosseim;;This paper describes the system deployed by the CLaC-EDLK team to the "SemEval 2016, Complex Word Identification task". The goal of the task is to identify if a given word in a given context is "simple" or "complex". Our system relies on linguistic features and cognitive complexity. We used several supervised models, however the Random Forest model outperformed the others. Overall our best configuration achieved a G-score of 68.8% in the task, ranking our system 21 out of 45.;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02843
Combining LSTM and Latent Topic Modeling for Mortality Prediction;;Yohan Jo, Lisa Lee, Shruti Palaskar;;There is a great need for technologies that can predict the mortality of patients in intensive care units with both high accuracy and accountability. We present joint end-to-end neural network architectures that combine long short-term memory (LSTM) and a latent topic model to simultaneously train a classifier for mortality prediction and learn latent topics indicative of mortality from textual clinical notes. For topic interpretability, the topic modeling layer has been carefully designed as a single-layer network with constraints inspired by LDA. Experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset show that our models significantly outperform prior models that are based on LDA topics in mortality prediction. However, we achieve limited success with our method for interpreting topics from the trained models by looking at the neural network weights.;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02842
Globally Normalized Reader;;Jonathan Raiman, John Miller;;Rapid progress has been made towards question answering (QA) systems that can extract answers from text. Existing neural approaches make use of expensive bi-directional attention mechanisms or score all possible answer spans, limiting scalability. We propose instead to cast extractive QA as an iterative search problem: select the answer's sentence, start word, and end word. This representation reduces the space of each search step and allows computation to be conditionally allocated to promising search paths. We show that globally normalizing the decision process and back-propagating through beam search makes this representation viable and learning efficient. We empirically demonstrate the benefits of this approach using our model, Globally Normalized Reader (GNR), which achieves the second highest single model performance on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (68.4 EM, 76.21 F1 dev) and is 24.7x faster than bi-attention-flow. We also introduce a data-augmentation method to produce semantically valid examples by aligning named entities to a knowledge base and swapping them with new entities of the same type. This method improves the performance of all models considered in this work and is of independent interest for a variety of NLP tasks.;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02828
Social Media Text Processing and Semantic Analysis for Smart Cities;;João Filipe Figueiredo Pereira;;With the rise of Social Media, people obtain and share information almost instantly on a 24/7 basis. Many research areas have tried to gain valuable insights from these large volumes of freely available user generated content. With the goal of extracting knowledge from social media streams that might be useful in the context of intelligent transportation systems and smart cities, we designed and developed a framework that provides functionalities for parallel collection of geo-located tweets from multiple pre-defined bounding boxes (cities or regions), including filtering of non-complying tweets, text pre-processing for Portuguese and English language, topic modeling, and transportation-specific text classifiers, as well as, aggregation and data visualization. We performed an exploratory data analysis of geo-located tweets in 5 different cities: Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, New York City, London and Melbourne, comprising a total of more than 43 million tweets in a period of 3 months. Furthermore, we performed a large scale topic modelling comparison between Rio de Janeiro and S\~ao Paulo. Interestingly, most of the topics are shared between both cities which despite being in the same country are considered very different regarding population, economy and lifestyle. We take advantage of recent developments in word embeddings and train such representations from the collections of geo-located tweets. We then use a combination of bag-of-embeddings and traditional bag-of-words to train travel-related classifiers in both Portuguese and English to filter travel-related content from non-related. We created specific gold-standard data to perform empirical evaluation of the resulting classifiers. Results are in line with research work in other application areas by showing the robustness of using word embeddings to learn word similarities that bag-of-words is not able to capture.;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03406
Sentiment Polarity Detection for Software Development;;Fabio Calefato, Filippo Lanubile, Federico Maiorano, Nicole Novielli;;The role of sentiment analysis is increasingly emerging to study software developers' emotions by mining crowd-generated content within social software engineering tools. However, off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools have been trained on non-technical domains and general-purpose social media, thus resulting in misclassifications of technical jargon and problem reports. Here, we present Senti4SD, a classifier specifically trained to support sentiment analysis in developers' communication channels. Senti4SD is trained and validated using a gold standard of Stack Overflow questions, answers, and comments manually annotated for sentiment polarity. It exploits a suite of both lexicon- and keyword-based features, as well as semantic features based on word embedding. With respect to a mainstream off-the-shelf tool, which we use as a baseline, Senti4SD reduces the misclassifications of neutral and positive posts as emotionally negative. To encourage replications, we release a lab package including the classifier, the word embedding space, and the gold standard with annotation guidelines.;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02984
Matrix and Graph Operations for Relationship Inference: An Illustration with the Kinship Inference in the China Biographical Database;;Chao-Lin Liu, Hongsu Wang;;Biographical databases contain diverse information about individuals. Person names, birth information, career, friends, family and special achievements are some possible items in the record for an individual. The relationships between individuals, such as kinship and friendship, provide invaluable insights about hidden communities which are not directly recorded in databases. We show that some simple matrix and graph-based operations are effective for inferring relationships among individuals, and illustrate the main ideas with the China Biographical Database (CBDB).;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02968
A Statistical Comparison of Some Theories of NP Word Order;;Richard Futrell, Roger Levy, Matthew Dryer;;A frequent object of study in linguistic typology is the order of elements {demonstrative, adjective, numeral, noun} in the noun phrase. The goal is to predict the relative frequencies of these orders across languages. Here we use Poisson regression to statistically compare some prominent accounts of this variation. We compare feature systems derived from Cinque (2005) to feature systems given in Cysouw (2010) and Dryer (in prep). In this setting, we do not find clear reasons to prefer the model of Cinque (2005) or Dryer (in prep), but we find both of these models have substantially better fit to the typological data than the model from Cysouw (2010).;;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02783
