Control-Oriented Learning on the Fly;Melkior Ornik, Arie Israel, Ufuk Topcu;This paper focuses on developing a strategy for satisfying basic control objectives for systems whose dynamics are almost entirely unknown. This situation arises naturally in a scenario where a system undergoes a critical failure, thus significantly changing its dynamics. In that case, it is imperative to retain the ability to satisfy basic control objectives in order to avert an imminent catastrophe. A prime example of such an objective is the reach-avoid problem, where a system needs to move to a certain state in a constrained state space. To deal with significant restrictions on our knowledge of system dynamics, we develop a theory of myopic control. The primary goal of myopic control is to, at any given time, optimize the current direction of the system trajectory, given solely the limited information obtained about the system until that time. Building upon this notion, we propose a control algorithm which simultaneously uses small perturbations in the control effort to learn local system dynamics while moving in the direction which seems to be optimal based on previously obtained knowledge. We prove that the algorithm results in a trajectory that is nearly optimal in the myopic sense, i.e., it is moving in a direction that seems to be nearly the best at the given time. We provide hard bounds for suboptimality of the proposed algorithm, and show that the algorithm results in a control law that is arbitrarily close to a myopically-optimal control law. We verify the usefulness of the proposed algorithm on a number of simulations based on the running example of a damaged aircraft seeking to land, as well as on a classical example of a Van der Pol oscillator.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04889
The Impact of Local Geometry and Batch Size on the Convergence and Divergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent;Vivak Patel;Stochastic small-batch (SB) methods, such as mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), have been extremely successful in training neural networks with strong generalization properties. In the work of Keskar et. al (2017), an SB method's success in training neural networks was attributed to the fact it converges to flat minima---those minima whose Hessian has only small eigenvalues---while a large-batch (LB) method converges to sharp minima---those minima whose Hessian has a few large eigenvalues. Commonly, this difference is attributed to the noisier gradients in SB methods that allow SB iterates to escape from sharp minima. While this explanation is intuitive, in this work we offer an alternative mechanism. In this work, we argue that SGD escapes from or converges to minima based on a deterministic relationship between the learning rate, the batch size, and the local geometry of the minimizer. We derive the exact relationships by a rigorous mathematical analysis of the canonical quadratic sums problem. Then, we numerically study how these relationships extend to nonconvex, stochastic optimization problems. As a consequence of this work, we offer a more complete explanation of why SB methods prefer flat minima and LB methods seem agnostic, which can be leveraged to design SB and LB training methods that have tailored optimization properties.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04718
Heuristics with Performance Guarantees for the Minimum Number of Matches Problem in Heat Recovery Network Design;Dimitrios Letsios, Georgia Kouyialis, Ruth Misener;Heat exchanger network synthesis exploits excess heat by integrating process hot and cold streams and improves energy efficiency by reducing utility usage. Determining the minimum number of matches is the bottleneck of designing a heat recovery network using the sequential method. This subproblem is an NP-hard mixed-integer linear program exhibiting combinatorial explosion in the possible hot and cold stream configurations. We explore this challenging optimization problem from a graph theoretic perspective and correlate it with other special optimization problems such as cost flow network and packing problems. In the case of a single temperature interval, we develop a new optimization formulation without problematic big-M parameters. We develop heuristic methods with performance guarantees using three approaches: (i) relaxation rounding, (ii) water filling, and (iii) greedy packing. Numerical results from a collection of 48 instances substantiate the strength of the methods.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04688
A Rewriting System for Convex Optimization Problems;Akshay Agrawal, Robin Verschueren, Steven Diamond, Stephen Boyd;We describe a modular rewriting system for translating optimization problems written in a domain-specific language to forms compatible with low-level solver interfaces. Translation is facilitated by reductions, which accept a category of problems and transform instances of that category to equivalent instances of another category. Our system proceeds in two key phases: analysis, in which we attempt to find a suitable solver for a supplied problem, and canonicalization, in which we rewrite the problem in the selected solver's standard form. We implement the described system in version 1.0 of CVXPY, a domain-specific language for mathematical and especially convex optimization. By treating reductions as first-class objects, our method makes it easy to match problems to solvers well-suited for them and to support solvers with a wide variety of standard forms.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04494
On proximal mappings with Young functions in uniformly convex Banach spaces;Miroslav Bacak, Ulrich Kohlenbach;It is well known in convex analysis that proximal mappings on Hilbert spaces are 1-Lipschitz. In the present paper we show that proximal mappings on uniformly convex Banach spaces are uniformly continuous on bounded sets. Moreover, we introduce a new general proximal mapping whose regularization term is given as a composition of a Young function and the norm, and formulate our results at this level of generality. It is our aim to obtain the corresponding modulus of uniform continuity explicitly in terms of a modulus of uniform convexity of the norm and of moduli witnessing properties of the Young function. We also derive several quantitative results on uniform convexity, which may be of interest on their own.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04700
Scalability Evaluation of NSLP Algorithm for Solving Non-Stationary Linear Programming Problems on Cluster Computing Systems;Irina Sokolinskaya, Leonid B. Sokolinsky;The paper is devoted to a scalability study of the NSLP algorithm for solving non-stationary high-dimension linear programming problem on the cluster computing systems. The analysis is based on the BSF model of parallel computations. The BSF model is a new parallel computation model designed on the basis of BSP and SPMD models. The brief descriptions of the NSLP algorithm and the BSF model are given. The NSLP algorithm implementation in the form of a BSF program is considered. On the basis of the BSF cost metric, the upper bound of the NSLP algorithm scalability is derived and its parallel efficiency is estimated. NSLP algorithm implementation using BSF skeleton is described. A comparison of scalability estimations obtained analytically and experimentally is provided.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04640
Random matrix approach for primal-dual portfolio optimization problems;Daichi Tada, Hisashi Yamamoto, Takashi Shinzato;In this paper, we revisit the portfolio optimization problems of the minimization/maximization of investment risk under constraints of budget and investment concentration (primal problem) and the maximization/minimization of investment concentration under constraints of budget and investment risk (dual problem) for the case that the variances of the return rates of the assets are identical. We analyze both optimization problems by using the Lagrange multiplier method and the random matrix approach. Thereafter, we compare the results obtained from our proposed approach with the results obtained in previous work. Moreover, we use numerical experiments to validate the results obtained from the replica approach and the random matrix approach as methods for analyzing both the primal and dual portfolio optimization problems.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04620
State-Secrecy Codes for Networked Linear Systems;Anastasios Tsiamis, Konstantinos Gatsis, George J. Pappas;In this paper, we study the problem of remote state estimation, in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. An authorized user estimates the state of an unstable linear plant, based on the packets received from a sensor, while the packets may also be intercepted by the eavesdropper. Our goal is to design a coding scheme at the sensor, which encodes the state information, in order to impair the eavesdropper's estimation performance, while enabling the user to successfully decode the sent messages. We introduce a novel class of codes, termed State-Secrecy Codes, which use acknowledgment signals from the user and apply linear time-varying transformations to the current and previously received states. By exploiting the properties of the system's process noise, the channel physical model and the dynamics, these codes manage to be fast, efficient and, thus, suitable for real-time dynamical systems. We prove that under minimal conditions, State-Secrecy Codes achieve perfect secrecy, namely the eavesdropper's estimation error grows unbounded almost surely, while the user's estimation performance is optimal. These conditions only require that at least once, the user receives the corresponding packet while the eavesdropper fails to intercept it. Even one occurrence of this event renders the eavesdropper's error unbounded with asymptotically optimal rate of increase. State-Secrecy Codes are provided and studied for two cases, i) when direct state measurements are available, and ii) when we only have output measurements. The theoretical results are illustrated in simulations.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04530
Alternating minimization and alternating descent over nonconvex sets;Wooseok Ha, Rina Foygel Barber;Many optimization problems in high-dimensional statistics and signal processing involve more than one decision variable to be minimized, where the variables often reflect different structures or components within the signals being considered. Alternating minimization is a widely used method for solving such optimization problems, but the general properties of alternating minimization has not yet been understood well in some settings. In this work, we study and analyze the performance of alternating minimization under the setting where the loss function is optimized over two variables and each variable is restricted to its own constraint set - in particular, we allow these constraints to be potentially nonconvex. Our analysis depends strongly on the notion of local concavity coefficients, which have been recently proposed in Barber and Ha [2017] to measure and quantify the concavity of a general nonconvex set. Our results further reveal important distinctions between alternating and non-alternating methods. Since computing the alternating minimization steps may not be tractable for some problems, we also consider an inexact version of the algorithm and provide a set of sufficient conditions to ensure fast convergence of the inexact algorithms. We demonstrate our framework on two important examples of this type of problem, low rank + sparse decomposition and multitask regression, and provide numerical experiments to validate our theoretical results.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04451
Identifiability of dynamical networks: which nodes need be measured?;Alexandre S. Bazanella, Michel Gevers, Julien M. Hendrickx, Adriane Parraga;Much recent research has dealt with the identifiability of a dynamical network in which the node signals are connected by causal linear time-invariant transfer functions and are possibly excited by known external excitation signals and/or unknown noise signals. So far all results on the identifiability of the whole network have assumed that all node signals are measured. Under this assumption, it has been shown that such networks are identifiable only if some prior knowledge is available about the structure of the network, in particular the structure of the excitation. In this paper we present the first results for the situation where not all node signals are measurable, under the assumptions that the topology of the network is known, that each node is excited by a known signal and that the nodes are noise-free. Using graph theoretical properties, we show that the transfer functions that can be identified depend essentially on the topology of the paths linking the corresponding vertices to the measured nodes. An important outcome of our research is that, under those assumptions, a network can often be identified using only a small subset of node measurements.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04398
Solving nonlinear optimal control problems with state and control delays by shooting methods combined with numerical continuation on the delays;Riccardo Bonalli (1), Bruno Hérissé (1), Emmanuel Trélat (2) ((1) Palaiseau, (2) CaGE);In this paper we introduce a new procedure to solve nonlinear optimal control problems with delays which exploits indirect methods combined with numerical homotopy procedures. It is known that solving this kind of problems via indirect methods (which arise from the Pontrya-gin Maximum Principle) is complex and computationally demanding because their implementation is faced to two main difficulties: the extremal equations involve forward and backward terms, and besides, the related shooting method has to be carefully initialized. Here, starting from the solution of the non-delayed version of the optimal control problem, delays are introduced by a numerical continuation. This creates a sequence of optimal delayed solutions that converges to the desired solution. We establish a convergence theorem ensuring the continuous dependence w.r.t. the delay of the optimal state, of the optimal control (in a weak sense) and of the corresponding adjoint vector. The convergence of the adjoint vector represents the most challenging step to prove and it is crucial for the well-posedness of the proposed homotopy procedure. Two numerical examples are proposed and analyzed to show the efficiency of this approach.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04383
Multi-ordered Lasserre hierarchy for large scale polynomial optimization in real and complex variables;Cedric Josz, Daniel K. Molzahn;We propose general notions to deal with large scale polynomial optimization problems and demonstrate their efficiency on a key industrial problem of the twenty first century, namely the optimal power flow problem. These notions enable us to find global minimizers on instances with up to 4,500 variables and 14,500 constraints. First, we generalize the Lasserre hierarchy from real to complex to numbers in order to enhance its tractability when dealing with complex polynomial optimization. Complex numbers are typically used to represent oscillatory phenomena, which are omnipresent in physical systems. Using the notion of hyponormality in operator theory, we provide a finite convergence criterion which generalizes the Curto-Fialkow conditions of the real Lasserre hierarchy. Second, we introduce the multi-ordered Lasserre hierarchy in order to exploit sparsity in polynomial optimization problems (in real or complex variables) while preserving global convergence. It is based on two ideas: 1) to use a different relaxation order for each constraint, and 2) to iteratively seek a closest measure to the truncated moment data until a measure matches the truncated data. Third and last, we exhibit a block diagonal structure of the Lasserre hierarchy in the presence of commonly encountered symmetries.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04376
Delay-robust control design for two heterodirectional linear coupled hyperbolic PDEs;Jean Auriol (1), Jakob Ulf, Philippe Martin (1), Florent Meglio (1) ((1) CAS);We detail in this article the necessity of a change of paradigm for the delay-robust control of systems composed of two linear first order hyperbolic equations. One must go back to the classical trade-off between convergence rate and delay-robustness. More precisely, we prove that, for systems with strong reflections, canceling the reflection at the actuated boundary will yield zero delay-robustness. Indeed, for such systems, using a backstepping-controller, the corresponding target system should preserve a small amount of this reflection to ensure robustness to a small delay in the loop. This implies, in some cases, giving up finite time convergence.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04274
Strong local optimality for generalized L 1 optimal control problems;Francesca Chittaro (1), Laura Poggiolini (2) ((1) LSIS, (2) DMA);In this paper, we analyse control affine optimal control problems with a cost functional involving the absolute value of the control. The Pontryagin extremals associated with such systems are given by (possible) concatenations of bang arcs with singular arcs and with inactivated arcs, that is, arcs where the control is identically zero. Here we consider Pontryagin extremals given by a bang-inactive-bang concatenation. We establish sufficient optimality conditions for such extremals, in terms of some regularity conditions and of the coercivity of a suitable finite-dimensional second variation.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04266
Two-step benchmarking: Setting more realistically achievable targets in DEA;Nuria Ramón, José L. Ruiz, Inmaculada Sirvent;The models that set the closest targets have made an important contribution to DEA as tool for the best-practice benchmarking of decision making units (DMUs). These models may help defining plans for improvement that require less effort from the DMUs. However, in practice we often find cases of poor performance, for which closest targets are still unattainable. For those DMUs, we propose a two-step benchmarking approach within the spirit of context-dependent DEA and that of the models that minimize the distance to the DEA efficient frontier. This approach allows to setting more realistically achievable targets in the short term. In addition, it may offer different alternatives for planning improvements directed towards DEA efficient targets, which can be seen as representing improvements in a long term perspective. To illustrate, we examine an example which is concerned with the research performance of public Spanish universities.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04236
Numerical Study of Polynomial Feedback Laws for a Bilinear Control Problem;Tobias Breiten, Karl Kunisch, Laurent Pfeiffer;An infinite-dimensional bilinear optimal control problem with infinite-time horizon is considered. The associated value function can be expanded in a Taylor series around the equilibrium, the Taylor series involving multilinear forms which are uniquely characterized by generalized Lyapunov equations. A numerical method for solving these equations is proposed. It is based on a generalization of the balanced truncation model reduction method and some techniques of tensor calculus, in order to attenuate the curse of dimensionality. Polynomial feedback laws are derived from the Taylor expansion and are numerically investigated for a control problem of the Fokker-Planck equation. Their efficiency is demonstrated for initial values which are sufficiently close to the equilibrium.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04227
Breaking Bellman's Curse of Dimensionality: Efficient Kernel Gradient Temporal Difference;Alec Koppel, Garrett Warnell, Ethan Stump, Peter Stone, Alejandro Ribeiro;We consider policy evaluation in infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision problems (MDPs) with infinite spaces. We reformulate this task a compositional stochastic program with a function-valued decision variable that belongs to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). We approach this problem via a new functional generalization of stochastic quasi-gradient methods operating in tandem with stochastic sparse subspace projections. The result is an extension of gradient temporal difference learning that yields nonlinearly parameterized value function estimates of the solution to the Bellman evaluation equation. Our main contribution is a memory-efficient non-parametric stochastic method guaranteed to converge exactly to the Bellman fixed point with probability with attenuating step-sizes. Further, with constant step-sizes, we obtain mean convergence to a neighborhood and that the value function estimates have finite complexity. In the Mountain Car domain, we observe faster convergence to lower Bellman error solutions than existing approaches with a fraction of the required memory.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04221
Long time behavior of the master equation in mean-field game theory;Pierre Cardaliaguet (1), Alessio Porretta (2) ((1) CEREMADE, (2) DIPMAT);Mean Field Game (MFG) systems describe equilibrium configurations in games with infinitely many interacting controllers. We are interested in the behavior of this system as the horizon becomes large, or as the discount factor tends to 0. We show that, in the two cases, the asymptotic behavior of the Mean Field Game system is strongly related with the long time behavior of the so-called master equation and with the vanishing discount limit of the discounted master equation, respectively. Both equations are nonlinear transport equations in the space of measures. We prove the existence of a solution to an ergodic master equation, towards which the time-dependent master equation converges as the horizon becomes large, and towards which the discounted master equation converges as the discount factor tends to 0. The whole analysis is based on the obtention of new estimates for the exponential rates of convergence of the time-dependent MFG system and the discounted MFG system.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04215
Setpoint Tracking with Partially Observed Loads;Antoine Lesage-Landry, Joshua A. Taylor;We use online convex optimization (OCO) for setpoint tracking with uncertain, flexible loads. We consider full feedback from the loads, bandit feedback, and two intermediate types of feedback: partial bandit where a subset of the loads are individually observed and the rest are observed in aggregate, and Bernoulli feedback where in each round the aggregator receives either full or bandit feedback according to a known probability. We give sublinear regret bounds in all cases. We numerically evaluate our algorithms on examples with thermostatically controlled loads and electric vehicles.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04077
