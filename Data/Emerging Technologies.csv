Error tracing in linear and concatenated quantum circuits;Ritajit Majumdar, Saikat Basu, Priyanka Mukhopadhyay, Susmita Sur-Kolay;Descriptions of quantum algorithms, communication etc. protocols assume the existence of closed quantum system. However, real life quantum systems are open and are highly sensitive to errors. Hence error correction is of utmost importance if quantum computation is to be carried out in reality. Ideally, an error correction block should be placed after every gate operation in a quantum circuit. This increases the overhead and reduced the speedup of the quantum circuit. Moreover, the error correction blocks themselves may induce errors as the gates used for error correction may be noisy. In this paper, we have proposed a procedure to trace error probability due to noisy gates and decoherence in quantum circuit and place an error correcting block only when the error probability exceeds a certain threshold. This procedure shows a drastic reduction in the required number of error correcting blocks. Furthermore, we have considered concatenated codes with tile structure layout lattice architecture[25][21],[24] and SWAP gate based qubit transport mechanism. Tracing errors in higher levels of concatenation shows that, in most cases, after 1 or 2 levels of concatenation, the number of QECC blocks required become static. However, since the gate count increases with increasing concatenation, the percentage saving in gate count is considerably high.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08044
Flora robotica -- An Architectural System Combining Living Natural Plants and Distributed Robots;Heiko Hamann, Mohammad Divband Soorati, Mary Katherine Heinrich, Daniel Nicolas Hofstadler, Igor Kuksin, Frank Veenstra, Mostafa Wahby, Stig Anton Nielsen, Sebastian Risi, Tomasz Skrzypczak, Payam Zahadat, Przemyslaw Wojtaszek, Kasper Støy, Thomas Schmickl, Serge Kernbach, Phil Ayres;Key to our project flora robotica is the idea of creating a bio-hybrid system of tightly coupled natural plants and distributed robots to grow architectural artifacts and spaces. Our motivation with this ground research project is to lay a principled foundation towards the design and implementation of living architectural systems that provide functionalities beyond those of orthodox building practice, such as self-repair, material accumulation and self-organization. Plants and robots work together to create a living organism that is inhabited by human beings. User-defined design objectives help to steer the directional growth of the plants, but also the system's interactions with its inhabitants determine locations where growth is prohibited or desired (e.g., partitions, windows, occupiable space). We report our plant species selection process and aspects of living architecture. A leitmotif of our project is the rich concept of braiding: braids are produced by robots from continuous material and serve as both scaffolds and initial architectural artifacts before plants take over and grow the desired architecture. We use light and hormones as attraction stimuli and far-red light as repelling stimulus to influence the plants. Applied sensors range from simple proximity sensing to detect the presence of plants to sophisticated sensing technology, such as electrophysiology and measurements of sap flow. We conclude by discussing our anticipated final demonstrator that integrates key features of flora robotica, such as the continuous growth process of architectural artifacts and self-repair of living architecture.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04291
Charge-based computing with analogue reconfigurable gates;Alexantrou Serb, Ali Khiat, Themis Prodromakis;As the world enters the age of ubiquitous computing, the need for reconfigurable hardware operating close to the fundamental limits of energy consumption becomes increasingly pressing. Simultaneously, scaling-driven performance improvements within the framework of traditional analogue and digital design become progressively more restricted by fundamental physical constraints. Thus, a true paradigm shift in electronics design is required for fuelling the next big burst in technology. Here we lay the foundations of a new design paradigm that fuses analogue and digital thinking by combining digital electronics with memristive devices for achieving charge-based computation.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04184
A geographically distributed bio-hybrid neural network with memristive plasticity;Alexantrou Serb, Andrea Corna, Richard George, Ali Khiat, Federico Rocchi, Marco Reato, Marta Maschietto, Chirstian Mayr, Giacomo Indiveri, Stefano Vassanelli, Themistoklis Prodromakis;"Throughout evolution the brain has mastered the art of processing real-world inputs through networks of interlinked spiking neurons. Synapses have emerged as key elements that, owing to their plasticity, are merging neuron-to-neuron signalling with memory storage and computation. Electronics has made important steps in emulating neurons through neuromorphic circuits and synapses with nanoscale memristors, yet novel applications that interlink them in heterogeneous bio-inspired and bio-hybrid architectures are just beginning to materialise. The use of memristive technologies in brain-inspired architectures for computing or for sensing spiking activity of biological neurons8 are only recent examples, however interlinking brain and electronic neurons through plasticity-driven synaptic elements has remained so far in the realm of the imagination. Here, we demonstrate a bio-hybrid neural network (bNN) where memristors work as ""synaptors"" between rat neural circuits and VLSI neurons. The two fundamental synaptors, from artificial-to-biological (ABsyn) and from biological-to- artificial (BAsyn), are interconnected over the Internet. The bNN extends across Europe, collapsing spatial boundaries existing in natural brain networks and laying the foundations of a new geographically distributed and evolving architecture: the Internet of Neuro-electronics (IoN).";https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04179
Multi-level Memristive Memory with Resistive Networks;Aidana Irmanova, Alex Pappachen James;Analog memory is of great importance in neurocomputing technologies field, but still remains difficult to implement. With emergence of memristors in VLSI technologies the idea of designing scalable analog data storage elements finds its second wind. A memristor, known for its history dependent resistance levels, independently can provide blocks of binary or discrete state data storage. However, using single memristor to save the analog value is practically limited due to the device variability and implementation complexity. In this paper, we present a new design of discrete state memory cell consisting of subcells constructed from a memristor and its resistive network. A memristor in the sub-cells provides the storage element, while its resistive network is used for programming its resistance. Several sub-cells are then connected in parallel, resembling potential divider configuration. The output of the memory cell is the voltage resulting from distributing the input voltage among the sub-cells. Here, proposed design was programmed to obtain 10 and 27 different output levels depending on the configuration of the combined resistive networks within the sub-cell. Despite the simplicity of the circuit, this realization of multilevel memory provides increased number of output levels compared to previous designs of memory technologies based on memristors. Simulation results of proposed memory are analyzed providing explicit data on the issues of distinguishing discrete analog output levels and sensitivity of the cell to oscillations in write signal patterns.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04149
Power Optimizations in MTJ-based Neural Networks through Stochastic Computing;Ankit Mondal, Ankur Srivastava;Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have found widespread applications in tasks such as pattern recognition and image classification. However, hardware implementations of ANNs using conventional binary arithmetic units are computationally expensive, energy-intensive and have large area overheads. Stochastic Computing (SC) is an emerging paradigm which replaces these conventional units with simple logic circuits and is particularly suitable for fault-tolerant applications. Spintronic devices, such as Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), are capable of replacing CMOS in memory and logic circuits. In this work, we propose an energy-efficient use of MTJs, which exhibit probabilistic switching behavior, as Stochastic Number Generators (SNGs), which forms the basis of our NN implementation in the SC domain. Further, error resilient target applications of NNs allow us to introduce Approximate Computing, a framework wherein accuracy of computations is traded-off for substantial reductions in power consumption. We propose approximating the synaptic weights in our MTJ-based NN implementation, in ways brought about by properties of our MTJ-SNG, to achieve energy-efficiency. We design an algorithm that can perform such approximations within a given error tolerance in a single-layer NN in an optimal way owing to the convexity of the problem formulation. We then use this algorithm and develop a heuristic approach for approximating multi-layer NNs. To give a perspective of the effectiveness of our approach, a 43% reduction in power consumption was obtained with less than 1% accuracy loss on a standard classification problem, with 26% being brought about by the proposed algorithm.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04322
Quantum error correction for non-maximally entangled states;Ritajit Majumdar, Susmita Sur-Kolay;Quantum states have high affinity for errors and hence error correction is of utmost importance to realise a quantum computer. Laflamme showed that 5 qubits are necessary to correct a single error on a qubit. In a Pauli error model, four different types of errors can occur on a qubit. Maximally entangled states are orthogonal to each other and hence can be uniquely distinguished by a measurement in the Bell basis. Thus a measurement in Bell basis and a unitary transformation is sufficient to correct error in Bell states. However, such a measurement is not possible for non-maximally entangled states. In this work we show that the 16 possible errors for a non-maximally entangled two qubit system map to only 8 distinct error states. Hence, it is possible to correct the error without perfect knowledge of the type of error. Furthermore, we show that the possible errors can be grouped in such a way that all 4 errors can occur on one qubit, whereas only bit flip error can occur on the second qubit. As a consequence, instead of 10, only 8 qubits are sufficient to correct a single error. We propose an 8-qubit error correcting code to correct a single error in a non-maximally entangled state. We further argue that for an;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04301
Is Smaller Better: A Proposal To Consider Bacteria For Biologically Inspired Modeling;Archana Ram, Andrew Lo;Bacteria are easily characterizable model organisms with an impressively complicated set of capabilities. Among their capabilities is quorum sensing, a detailed cell-cell signaling system that may have a common origin with eukaryotic cell-cell signaling. Not only are the two phenomena similar, but quorum sensing, as is the case with any bacterial phenomenon when compared to eukaryotes, is also easier to study in depth than eukaryotic cell-cell signaling. This ease of study is a contrast to the only partially understood cellular dynamics of neurons. Here we review the literature on the strikingly neuron-like qualities of bacterial colonies and biofilms, including ion-based and hormonal signaling, and action potential-like behavior. This allows them to feasibly act as an analog for neurons that could produce more detailed and more accurate biologically-based computational models. Using bacteria as the basis for biologically feasible computational models may allow models to better harness the tremendous ability of biological organisms to make decisions and process information. Additionally, principles gleaned from bacterial function have the potential to influence computational efforts divorced from biology, just as neuronal function has in the abstract influenced countless machine learning efforts.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04300
Macro-molecular data storage with petabyte/cm^3 density, highly parallel read/write operations, and genuine 3D storage capability;Masud Mansuripur, Pramod Khulbe;"Digital information can be encoded in the building-block sequence of macro-molecules, such as RNA and single-stranded DNA.

As a first step toward demonstrating the feasibility of this concept, we report preliminary results of DNA readout experiments conducted in miniaturized chambers that are scalable to even smaller dimensions. We show that translocation of a single-stranded DNA molecule (consisting of 50 adenosine bases followed by 100 cytosine bases) through an ion-channel yields a characteristic signal that is attributable to the 2-segment structure of the molecule. We also examine the dependence of the rate and speed of molecular translocation on the adjustable parameters of the experiment.";https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03596

Design Methods for Polymorphic Combinational Logic Circuits based on the Bi_Decomposition Approach;Zhifang Li, Wenjian Luo, Lihua Yue, Xufa Wang;Polymorphic circuits are a special kind of digital logic components, which possess multiple build-in functions. In different environments, a polymorphic circuit would perform different functions. Evolutionary Algorithms, Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD) and the multiplex method have been adopted to design polymorphic circuits. However, the evolutionary methods face the scalable problem. The BDD method consumes too much gate resource. The polymorphic circuit built by the multiplex method rarely contains polymorphic gates. In this paper, based on the traditional Bi_Decomposition circuit design approach, two methods, i.e. the Poly_Bi_Decomposition method and the Transformation&Bi_Decomposition method, are proposed for designing polymorphic circuits. The Poly_Bi_Decomposition method can design relatively large and gate-efficient polymorphic circuits with a higher percentage of polymorphic gates. The Transformation&Bi_Decomposition method can use the traditional circuit design approaches and tools, e.g. Bi_Decomposition, to design polymorphic circuits directly. The experimental results show the good performance of the proposed methods.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03067

Insertion Sort with Self-reproducing Comparator P System;Davood Pour Yousefian Barfeh, Neil P. Balba, Jaderick P. Pabico;We present in this paper a self-reproducing comparator P~system that simulates insertion sort. The comparator ?c is a degree-2 membrane and structured as ?=[h0[h1]h1[h2]h2]h0. A maximizing ?c compares two multisets a and b where min(|a|,|b|) is stored in compartment h1 while max(|a|,|b|) is stored in compartment h2. A conditional reproduction rule triggers ?c to clone itself out via compartment division followed by endocytosis of the cloned compartment.

A Real-time Trainable and Clock-less Spiking Neural Network with 1R Memristive Synapses;Aditya Shukla, Udayan Ganguly;Owing to their unexplored but potentially superior computational capability and remarkably low power consumption for executing brain-like tasks, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have come under the scope of several research groups. For modeling a network of spiking neurons and synapses highly parallelized hardware with a distributed and localized processor and memory is essential. Highly integrable resistive RAM or ReRAM, with voltage-pulse moldable analog conductivity, has a potential to play a key role in such a hardware model, as it can and has been shown to mimic a synapse and its time dependent plasticity. Being a two terminal device, however, it is not directly suitable for naturally/biologically asynchronous SNNs because it requires ability to do reading and writing concurrently. In this work, we overcome this challenge and present a clock-less approach to implement both learning and recognition on a spiking neural network with memristive synaptic array wherein, reading and writing are performed in different frequency domains. Further, we validate our scheme in SPICE by translating a mathematical mono-layered feed-forward Iris classifying SNN. A hardware implementation of the scheme will eliminate the need for clocks and switches to drive learning and has the potential to be used in the development of real-time trainable hardware recurrent networks.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02699
