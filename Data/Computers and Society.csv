Mr. Jones -- Towards a Proactive Smart Room Orchestrator;Tathagata Chakraborti, Kartik Talamadupula, Mishal Dholakia, Biplav Srivastava, Jeffrey O. Kephart, Rachel K. E. Bellamy;In this paper, we report work in progress on the development of Mr. Jones -- a proactive orchestrator and decision support agent for a collaborative decision making setting embodied by a smart room. The duties of such an agent may range across interactive problem solving with other agents in the environment, developing automated summaries of meetings, visualization of the internal decision making process, proactive data and resource management, and so on. Specifically, we highlight the importance of integrating higher level symbolic reasoning and intent recognition in the design of such an agent, and outline pathways towards the realization of these capabilities. We will demonstrate some of these functionalities here in the context of automated orchestration of a meeting in the CEL -- the Cognitive Environments Laboratory at IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04517
Information Design in Crowdfunding under Thresholding Policies;Wen Shen, Jacob W. Crandall, Ke Yan, Cristina V. Lopes;In crowdfunding, an entrepreneur often has to decide how to disclose the campaign status in order to collect as many contributions as possible. We propose information design as a tool to help the entrepreneur to improve revenue by influencing backers' beliefs. We introduce a heuristic algorithm to dynamically compute information-disclosure policies for the entrepreneur, followed by an empirical evaluation to demonstrate its competitiveness over the widely-adopted immediate-disclosure policy. Our work sheds light on information design in a dynamic setting where agents follow thresholding policies.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04049
Affective Neural Response Generation;Nabiha Asghar, Pascal Poupart, Jesse Hoey, Xin Jiang, Lili Mou;Existing neural conversational models process natural language primarily on a lexico-syntactic level, thereby ignoring one of the most crucial components of human-to-human dialogue: its affective content. We take a step in this direction by proposing three novel ways to incorporate affective/emotional aspects into long short term memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder neural conversation models: (1) affective word embeddings, which are cognitively engineered, (2) affect-based objective functions that augment the standard cross-entropy loss, and (3) affectively diverse beam search for decoding. Experiments show that these techniques improve the open-domain conversational prowess of encoder-decoder networks by enabling them to produce emotionally rich responses that are more interesting and natural.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03968
The Internet-of-Things Meets Business Process Management: Mutual Benefits and Challenges;Christian Janiesch, Agnes Koschmider, Massimo Mecella, Barbara Weber, Andrea Burattin, Claudio Di Ciccio, Avigdor Gal, Udo Kannengiesser, Felix Mannhardt, Jan Mendling, Andreas Oberweis, Manfred Reichert, Stefanie Rinderle-Ma, WenZhan Song, Jianwen Su, Victoria Torres, Matthias Weidlich, Mathias Weske, Liang Zhang;The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of connected devices collecting and exchanging data over the Internet. These things can be artificial or natural, and interact as autonomous agents forming a complex system. In turn, Business Process Management (BPM) was established to analyze, discover, design, implement, execute, monitor and evolve collaborative business processes within and across organizations. While the IoT and BPM have been regarded as separate topics in research and practice, we strongly believe that the management of IoT applications will strongly benefit from BPM concepts, methods and technologies on the one hand on the other one, the IoT poses challenges that will require enhancements and extensions of the current state-of-the-art in the BPM field. In this paper, we question to what extent these two paradigms can be combined and we discuss the emerging challenges.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03628
Quality of Information in Mobile Crowdsensing: Survey and Research Challenges;Francesco Restuccia, Nirnay Ghosh, Shameek Bhattacharjee, Sajal Das, Tommaso Melodia;Smartphones have become the most pervasive devices in people's lives, and are clearly transforming the way we live and perceive technology. Today's smartphones benefit from almost ubiquitous Internet connectivity and come equipped with a plethora of inexpensive yet powerful embedded sensors, such as accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone, and camera. This unique combination has enabled revolutionary applications based on the mobile crowdsensing paradigm, such as real-time road traffic monitoring, air and noise pollution, crime control, and wildlife monitoring, just to name a few. Differently from prior sensing paradigms, humans are now the primary actors of the sensing process, since they become fundamental in retrieving reliable and up-to-date information about the event being monitored. As humans may behave unreliably or maliciously, assessing and guaranteeing Quality of Information (QoI) becomes more important than ever. In this paper, we provide a new framework for defining and enforcing the QoI in mobile crowdsensing, and analyze in depth the current state-of-the-art on the topic. We also outline novel research challenges, along with possible directions of future work.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03583
Learning from development of a third-party patient-oriented application using Australian national personal health records system;Niranjan Bidargaddi;Large-scale national level Personal Health Record (PHR) has been implemented in Australia. However, usability, data quality and poor functionalities have resulted in low utility affecting enrollment and participation rates by both patients and clinicians alike. Development of new applications deriving secondary utility of data can enhance use of PHRs but there is limited understanding on processes involved in development of third-party applications with nationally run PHRs. This paper prsents an analysis of processes and regulatory requirements for developing applications of data from My Health Record, Australian nationally run PHR and subsequently implementation of a patient oriented software application using data sourced from My Health Record.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03577
Capturing the contributions of the semantic web to the IoT: a unifying vision;Nicolas Seydoux, Khalil Drira, Nathalie Hernandez, Thierry Monteil;The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technological topic with a very important societal impact. IoT application domains are various and include: smart cities, precision farming, smart factories, and smart buildings. The diversity of these application domains is the source of the very high technological heterogeneity in the IoT, leading to interoperability issues. The semantic web principles and technologies are more and more adopted as a solution to these interoperability issues, leading to the emergence of a new domain, the Semantic Web Of Things (SWoT). Scientific contributions to the SWoT are many, and the diversity of architectures in which they are expressed complicates comparison. To unify the presented architectures, we propose an architectural pattern, LMU-N. LMU-N provides a reading grid used to classify processes to which the SWoT community contributes, and to describe how the semantic web impacts the IoT. Then, the evolutions of the semantic web to adapt to the IoT constraints are described as well, in order to give a twofold view of the convergence between the IoT and the semantic web toward the SWoT.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03576
Conceptual Modeling for Control of a Physical Engineering Plant: A Case Study;Sabah Al-Fedaghi, Abdulaziz AlQallaf;We examine the problem of weaknesses in frameworks of conceptual modeling for handling certain aspects of the system being modeled. We propose the use of a flow-based modeling methodology at the conceptual level. Specifically, and without loss of generality, we develop a conceptual description that can be used for controlling the maintenance of a physical system, and demonstrate it by applying it to an existing electrical power plant system. Recent studies reveal difficulties in finding comprehensive answers for monitoring operations and identifying risks as well as the fact that incomplete information can easily lead to incorrect maintenance. A unified framework for integrated conceptualization is therefore needed. The conceptual modeling approach integrates maintenance operations into a total system comprising humans, physical objects, and information. The proposed model is constructed of (abstract) machines of things connected by flows, forming an integrated whole. It represents a man-made, intentionally constructed system and includes technical and human things observable in the real world, exemplified by the study case described in this paper. A specification is constructed from a maximum of five basic operations: creation, processing, releasing, transferring, and receiving.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03575
Establishing Personal Trust-based Connections in Distributed Teams;Fabio Calefato, Filippo Lanubile;Trust is a factor that dramatically contributes to the success or failure of distributed software teams. We present a research model showing that social communication between distant developers enables the affective appraisal of trustworthiness even from a distance, thus increasing project performance. To overcome the limitations of self-reported data, typically questionnaires, we focus on software projects following a pull request-based development model and approximate the overall performance of a software project with the history of successful collaborations occurring between developers.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03777
Reshaping Mobile Crowd Sensing using Cross Validation to Improve Data Credibility;Tie Luo, Leonit Zeynalvand;"Data credibility is a crucial issue in mobile crowd sensing (MCS) and, more generally, people-centric Internet of Things (IoT). Prior work takes approaches such as incentive mechanism design and data mining to address this issue, while overlooking the power of crowds itself, which we exploit in this paper. In particular, we propose a cross validation approach which seeks a validating crowd to verify the data credibility of the original sensing crowd, and uses the verification result to reshape the original sensing dataset into a more credible posterior belief of the ground truth. Following this approach, we design a specific cross validation mechanism, which integrates four sampling techniques with a privacy-aware competency-adaptive push (PACAP) algorithm and is applicable to time-sensitive and quality-critical MCS applications. It does not require redesigning a new MCS system but rather functions as a lightweight ""plug-in"", making it easier for practical adoption. Our results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism substantially improves data credibility in terms of both reinforcing obscure truths and scavenging hidden truths.";https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03495
Give Me a Like: How HIV/AIDS Nonprofit Organizations Can Engage Their Audience on Facebook;Yu-Chao Huang, Yi-Pin Lin, Gregory D. Saxton;With the rapid proliferation and adoption of social media among healthcare professionals and organizations, social media-based HIV/AIDS intervention programs have become increasingly popular. However, the question of the effectiveness of the HIV/AIDS messages disseminated via social media has received scant attention in the literature. The current study applies content analysis to examine the relationship between Facebook messaging strategies employed by 110 HIV/AIDS nonprofit organizations and audience reactions in the form of liking, commenting, and sharing behavior. The results reveal that HIV/AIDS nonprofit organizations often use informational messages as one-way communication with their audience instead of dialogic interactions. Some specific types of messages, such as medication-focused messages, engender better audience engagement, in contrast, event-related messages and call-to-action messages appear to translate into lower corresponding audience reactions. The findings provide guidance to HIV/AIDS organizations in developing effective social media communication strategies.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03220
Fairness Testing: Testing Software for Discrimination;Sainyam Galhotra, Yuriy Brun, Alexandra Meliou;This paper defines software fairness and discrimination and develops a testing-based method for measuring if and how much software discriminates, focusing on causality in discriminatory behavior. Evidence of software discrimination has been found in modern software systems that recommend criminal sentences, grant access to financial products, and determine who is allowed to participate in promotions. Our approach, Themis, generates efficient test suites to measure discrimination. Given a schema describing valid system inputs, Themis generates discrimination tests automatically and does not require an oracle. We evaluate Themis on 20 software systems, 12 of which come from prior work with explicit focus on avoiding discrimination. We find that (1) Themis is effective at discovering software discrimination, (2) state-of-the-art techniques for removing discrimination from algorithms fail in many situations, at times discriminating against as much as 98% of an input subdomain, (3) Themis optimizations are effective at producing efficient test suites for measuring discrimination, and (4) Themis is more efficient on systems that exhibit more discrimination. We thus demonstrate that fairness testing is a critical aspect of the software development cycle in domains with possible discrimination and provide initial tools for measuring software discrimination.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03221
Urban morphology meets deep learning: Exploring urban forms in one million cities, town and villages across the planet;Vahid Moosavi;Study of urban form is an important area of research in urban planning/design that contributes to our understanding of how cities function and evolve. However, classical approaches are based on very limited observations and inconsistent methods. As an alternative, availability of massive urban data collections such as Open Street Map from the one hand and the recent advancements in machine learning methods such as deep learning techniques on the other have opened up new possibilities to automatically investigate urban forms at the global scale. In this work for the first time, by collecting a large data set of street networks in more than one million cities, towns and villages all over the world, we trained a deep convolutional auto-encoder, that automatically learns the hierarchical structures of urban forms and represents them via dense and comparable vectors. We showed how the learned urban vectors could be used for different investigations. Using the learned urban vectors, one is able to easily find and compare similar urban forms all over the world, considering their overall spatial structure and other factors such as orientation, graphical structure, and density and partial deformations. Further cluster analysis reveals the distribution of the main patterns of urban forms all over the planet.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02939
