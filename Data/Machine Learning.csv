An Ensemble Classifier for Predicting the Onset of Type II Diabetes;John Semerdjian, Spencer Frank;Prediction of disease onset from patient survey and lifestyle data is quickly becoming an important tool for diagnosing a disease before it progresses. In this study, data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) questionnaire is used to predict the onset of type II diabetes. An ensemble model using the output of five classification algorithms was developed to predict the onset on diabetes based on 16 features. The ensemble model had an AUC of 0.834 indicating high performance.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07480
Bayesian Compressive Sensing Using Normal Product Priors;Zhou Zhou, Kaihui Liu, Jun Fang;"In this paper, we introduce a new sparsity-promoting prior, namely, the ""normal product"" prior, and develop an efficient algorithm for sparse signal recovery under the Bayesian framework. The normal product distribution is the distribution of a product of two normally distributed variables with zero means and possibly different variances. Like other sparsity-encouraging distributions such as the Student's t-distribution, the normal product distribution has a sharp peak at origin, which makes it a suitable prior to encourage sparse solutions. A two-stage normal product-based hierarchical model is proposed. We resort to the variational Bayesian (VB) method to perform the inference. Simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm as compared with other state-of-the-art compressed sensing algorithms.";https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07450
Dynamic Tensor Clustering;Will Wei Sun, Lexin Li;Dynamic tensor data are becoming prevalent in numerous applications. Existing tensor clustering methods either fail to account for the dynamic nature of the data, or are inapplicable to a general-order tensor. Also there is often a gap between statistical guarantee and computational efficiency for existing tensor clustering solutions. In this article, we aim to bridge this gap by proposing a new dynamic tensor clustering method, which takes into account both sparsity and fusion structures, and enjoys strong statistical guarantees as well as high computational efficiency. Our proposal is based upon a new structured tensor factorization that encourages both sparsity and smoothness in parameters along the specified tensor modes. Computationally, we develop a highly efficient optimization algorithm that benefits from substantial dimension reduction. In theory, we first establish a non-asymptotic error bound for the estimator from the structured tensor factorization. Built upon this error bound, we then derive the rate of convergence of the estimated cluster centers, and show that the estimated clusters recover the true cluster structures with a high probability. Moreover, our proposed method can be naturally extended to co-clustering of multiple modes of the tensor data. The efficacy of our approach is illustrated via simulations and a brain dynamic functional connectivity analysis from an Autism spectrum disorder study.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07259
GALILEO: A Generalized Low-Entropy Mixture Model;Cetin Savkli, Jeffrey Lin, Philip Graff, Matthew Kinsey;We present a new method of generating mixture models for data with categorical attributes. The keys to this approach are an entropy-based density metric in categorical space and annealing of high-entropy/low-density components from an initial state with many components. Pruning of low-density components using the entropy-based density allows GALILEO to consistently find high-quality clusters and the same optimal number of clusters. GALILEO has shown promising results on a range of test datasets commonly used for categorical clustering benchmarks. We demonstrate that the scaling of GALILEO is linear in the number of records in the dataset, making this method suitable for very large categorical datasets.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07242
Applications of Trajectory Data in Transportation: Literature Review and Maryland Case Study;Nikola Markovi?, Przemys?aw Seku?a, Zachary Vander Laan, Gennady Andrienko, Natalia Andrienko;This paper considers applications of trajectory data in transportation, and makes two primary contributions. First, it provides a comprehensive literature review detailing ways in which trajectory data has been used for transportation systems analysis, distilling existing research into the following six areas: demand estimation, modeling human behavior, designing public transit, measuring and predicting traffic performance, quantifying environmental impact, and safety analysis. Additionally, it presents innovative applications of trajectory data for the state of Maryland, employing visualization and machine learning techniques to extract value from 20 million GPS traces. These visual analytics will be implemented in the Regional Integrated Transportation Information System (RITIS), which provides free data sharing and visual analytics tools to help transportation agencies attain situational awareness, evaluate performance, and share insights with the public.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07193
Multivariate Dependency Measure based on Copula and Gaussian Kernel;Angshuman Roy, Alok Goswami, C. A. Murthy;We propose a new multivariate dependency measure. It is obtained by considering a Gaussian kernel based distance between the copula transform of the given d-dimensional distribution and the uniform copula and then appropriately normalizing it. The resulting measure is shown to satisfy a number of desirable properties. A nonparametric estimate is proposed for this dependency measure and its properties (finite sample as well as asymptotic) are derived. Some comparative studies of the proposed dependency measure estimate with some widely used dependency measure estimates on artificial datasets are included. A non-parametric test of independence between two or more random variables based on this measure is proposed. A comparison of the proposed test with some existing nonparametric multivariate test for independence is presented.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07485
Preconditioned Spectral Clustering for Stochastic Block Partition Streaming Graph Challenge;David Zhuzhunashvili, Andrew Knyazev;Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (LOBPCG) is demonstrated to efficiently solve eigenvalue problems for graph Laplacians that appear in spectral clustering. For static graph partitioning, 10-20 iterations of LOBPCG without preconditioning result in ~10x error reduction, enough to achieve 100% correctness for all Challenge datasets with known truth partitions, e.g., for graphs with 5K/.1M (50K/1M) Vertices/Edges in 2 (7) seconds, compared to over 5,000 (30,000) seconds needed by the baseline Python code. Our Python code 100% correctly determines 98 (160) clusters from the Challenge static graphs with 0.5M (2M) vertices in 270 (1,700) seconds using 10GB (50GB) of memory. Our single-precision MATLAB code calculates the same clusters at half time and memory. For streaming graph partitioning, LOBPCG is initiated with approximate eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian already computed for the previous graph, in many cases reducing 2-3 times the number of required LOBPCG iterations, compared to the static case. Our spectral clustering is generic, i.e. assuming nothing specific of the block model or streaming, used to generate the graphs for the Challenge, in contrast to the base code. Nevertheless, in 10-stage streaming comparison with the base code for the 5K graph, the quality of our clusters is similar or better starting at stage 4 (7) for emerging edging (snowballing) streaming, while the computations are over 100-1000 faster.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07481
Mixing time estimation in reversible Markov chains from a single sample path;Daniel Hsu, Aryeh Kontorovich, David A. Levin, Yuval Peres, Csaba Szepesvé†¨i;This article provides the first procedure for computing a fully data-dependent interval that traps the mixing time tmix of a finite reversible ergodic Markov chain at a prescribed confidence level. The interval is computed from a single finite-length sample path from the Markov chain, and does not require the knowledge of any parameters of the chain. This stands in contrast to previous approaches, which either only provide point estimates, or require a reset mechanism, or additional prior knowledge. The interval is constructed around the relaxation time trelax, which is strongly related to the mixing time, and the width of the interval converges to zero roughly at a n??? rate, where n is the length of the sample path. Upper and lower bounds are given on the number of samples required to achieve constant-factor multiplicative accuracy. The lower bounds indicate that, unless further restrictions are placed on the chain, no procedure can achieve this accuracy level before seeing each state at least ?(trelax) times on the average. Finally, future directions of research are identified.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02903
Ease.ml: Towards Multi-tenant Resource Sharing for Machine Learning Workloads;Tian Li, Jie Zhong, Ji Liu, Wentao Wu, Ce Zhang;"We present ease.ml, a declarative machine learning service platform we built to support more than ten research groups outside the computer science departments at ETH Zurich for their machine learning needs. With ease.ml, a user defines the high-level schema of a machine learning application and submits the task via a Web interface. The system automatically deals with the rest, such as model selection and data movement. In this paper, we describe the ease.ml architecture and focus on a novel technical problem introduced by ease.ml regarding resource allocation. We ask, as a ""service provider"" that manages a shared cluster of machines among all our users running machine learning workloads, what is the resource allocation strategy that maximizes the global satisfaction of all our users?";https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07308
On the Compressive Power of Deep Rectifier Networks for High Resolution Representation of Class Boundaries;Senjian An, Mohammed Bennamoun, Farid Boussaid;"This paper provides a theoretical justification of the superior classification performance of deep rectifier networks over shallow rectifier networks from the geometrical perspective of piecewise linear (PWL) classifier boundaries. We show that, for a given threshold on the approximation error, the required number of boundary facets to approximate a general smooth boundary grows exponentially with the dimension of the data, and thus the number of boundary facets, referred to as boundary resolution, of a PWL classifier is an important quality measure that can be used to estimate a lower bound on the classification errors. However, learning naively an exponentially large number of boundary facets requires the determination of an exponentially large number of parameters and also requires an exponentially large number of training patterns. To overcome this issue of ""curse of dimensionality"", compressive representations of high resolution classifier boundaries are required. To show the superior compressive power of deep rectifier networks over shallow rectifier networks, we prove that the maximum boundary resolution of a single hidden layer rectifier network classifier grows exponentially with the number of units when this number is smaller than the dimension of the patterns. When the number of units is larger than the dimension of the patterns, the growth rate is reduced to a polynomial order. Consequently, the capacity of generating a high resolution boundary will increase if the same large number of units are arranged in multiple layers instead of a single hidden layer. Taking high dimensional spherical boundaries as examples, we show how deep rectifier networks can utilize geometric symmetries to approximate a boundary with the same accuracy but with a significantly fewer number of parameters than single hidden layer nets.";https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07244
Massively-Parallel Feature Selection for Big Data;Ioannis Tsamardinos, Giorgos Borboudakis, Pavlos Katsogridakis, Polyvios Pratikakis, Vassilis Christophides;We present the Parallel, Forward-Backward with Pruning (PFBP) algorithm for feature selection (FS) in Big Data settings (high dimensionality and/or sample size). To tackle the challenges of Big Data FS PFBP partitions the data matrix both in terms of rows (samples, training examples) as well as columns (features). By employing the concepts of p-values of conditional independence tests and meta-analysis techniques PFBP manages to rely only on computations local to a partition while minimizing communication costs. Then, it employs powerful and safe (asymptotically sound) heuristics to make early, approximate decisions, such as Early Dropping of features from consideration in subsequent iterations, Early Stopping of consideration of features within the same iteration, or Early Return of the winner in each iteration. PFBP provides asymptotic guarantees of optimality for data distributions faithfully representable by a causal network (Bayesian network or maximal ancestral graph). Our empirical analysis confirms a super-linear speedup of the algorithm with increasing sample size, linear scalability with respect to the number of features and processing cores, while dominating other competitive algorithms in its class.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07178
Human experts vs. machines in taxa recognition;L. Azzimonti, G. Corani, M. Zaffalon;We present a novel approach for estimating conditional probability tables, based on a joint, rather than independent, estimate of the conditional distributions belonging to the same table. We derive exact analytical expressions for the estimators and we analyse their properties both analytically and via simulation. We then apply this method to the estimation of parameters in a Bayesian network. Given the structure of the network, the proposed approach better estimates the joint distribution and significantly improves the classification performance with respect to traditional approaches.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06935
Super-Convergence: Very Fast Training of Residual Networks Using Large Learning Rates;Johanna è†”je, Ville Tirronen, Salme Ké‹œkké‹“nen, Kristian Meissner, Jenni Raitoharju, Moncef Gabbouj, Serkan Kiranyaz;Biomonitoring of waterbodies is vital as the number of anthropogenic stressors on aquatic ecosystems keeps growing. However, the continuous decrease in funding makes it impossible to meet monitoring goals or sustain traditional manual sample processing. In this paper, we review what kind of statistical tools can be used to enhance the cost efficiency of biomonitoring: We explore automated identification of freshwater macroinvertebrates which are used as one indicator group in biomonitoring of aquatic ecosystems. We present the first classification results of a new imaging system producing multiple images per specimen. Moreover, these results are compared with the results of human experts. On a data set of 29 taxonomical groups, automated classification produces a higher average accuracy than human experts.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06899
Scale-invariant unconstrained online learning;Leslie N. Smith, Nicholay Topin;"In this paper, we show a phenomenon where residual networks can be trained using an order of magnitude fewer iterations than is used with standard training methods, which we named ""super-convergence"". One of the key elements of super-convergence is training with cyclical learning rates and a large maximum learning rate. Furthermore, we present evidence that training with large learning rates improves performance by regularizing the network. In addition, we show that super-convergence provides a greater boost in performance relative to standard training when the amount of labeled training data is limited. We also provide an explanation for the benefits of a large learning rate using a simplification of the Hessian Free optimization method to compute an estimate of the optimal learning rate. The architectures and code to replicate the figures in this paper are available at github.com/lnsmith54/super-convergence.";https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07120
Bayesian Learning of Clique Tree Structure;Wojciech Kot?owski;"We consider a variant of online convex optimization in which both the instances (input vectors) and the comparator (weight vector) are unconstrained. We exploit a natural scale invariance symmetry in our unconstrained setting: the predictions of the optimal comparator are invariant under any linear transformation of the instances. Our goal is to design online algorithms which also enjoy this property, i.e. are scale-invariant. We start with the case of coordinate-wise invariance, in which the individual coordinates (features) can be arbitrarily rescaled. We give an algorithm, which achieves essentially optimal regret bound in this setup, expressed by means of a coordinate-wise scale-invariant norm of the comparator. We then study general invariance with respect to arbitrary linear transformations. We first give a negative result, showing that no algorithm can achieve a meaningful bound in terms of scale-invariant norm of the comparator in the worst case. Next, we compliment this result with a positive one, providing an algorithm which ""almost"" achieves the desired bound, incurring only a logarithmic overhead in terms of the norm of the instances.";https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07042
Variational autoencoders for tissue heterogeneity exploration from (almost) no preprocessed mass spectrometry imaging data;Cetin Savkli, J.

Dynamic Input Structure and Network Assembly for Few-Shot Learning;Marco Melis, Ambra Demontis, Battista Biggio, Gavin Brown, Giorgio Fumera, Fabio Roli;Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in recent years, exhibiting impressive performances in several application domains. It has however been shown that they can be fooled by adversarial examples, i.e., images altered by a barely-perceivable adversarial noise, carefully crafted to mislead classification. In this work, we aim to evaluate the extent to which robot-vision systems embodying deep-learning algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and propose a computationally efficient countermeasure to mitigate this threat, based on rejecting classification of anomalous inputs. We then provide a clearer understanding of the safety properties of deep networks through an intuitive empirical analysis, showing that the mapping learned by such networks essentially violates the smoothness assumption of learning algorithms. We finally discuss the main limitations of this work, including the creation of real-world adversarial examples, and sketch promising research directions.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06939
Learning Combinations of Sigmoids Through Gradient Estimation;Nathan Hilliard, Nathan O. Hodas, Courtney D. Corley;The ability to learn from a small number of examples has been a difficult problem in machine learning since its inception. While methods have succeeded with large amounts of training data, research has been underway in how to accomplish similar performance with fewer examples, known as one-shot or more generally few-shot learning. This technique has been shown to have promising performance, but in practice requires fixed-size inputs making it impractical for production systems where class sizes can vary. This impedes training and the final utility of few-shot learning systems. This paper describes an approach to constructing and training a network that can handle arbitrary example sizes dynamically as the system is used.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06819
Sum-Product Graphical Models;Stratis Ioannidis, Andrea Montanari;We develop a new approach to learn the parameters of regression models with hidden variables. In a nutshell, we estimate the gradient of the regression function at a set of random points, and cluster the estimated gradients. The centers of the clusters are used as estimates for the parameters of hidden units. We justify this approach by studying a toy model, whereby the regression function is a linear combination of sigmoids. We prove that indeed the estimated gradients concentrate around the parameter vectors of the hidden units, and provide non-asymptotic bounds on the number of required samples. To the best of our knowledge, no comparable guarantees have been proven for linear combinations of sigmoids.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06678
A Tutorial on Hawkes Processes for Events in Social Media;Mattia Desana, Christoph Schné°Žr;This paper introduces a new probabilistic architecture called Sum-Product Graphical Model (SPGM). SPGMs combine traits from Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) and Graphical Models (GMs): Like SPNs, SPGMs always enable tractable inference using a class of models that incorporate context specific independence. Like GMs, SPGMs provide a high-level model interpretation in terms of conditional independence assumptions and corresponding factorizations. Thus, the new architecture represents a class of probability distributions that combines, for the first time, the semantics of graphical models with the evaluation efficiency of SPNs. We also propose a novel algorithm for learning both the structure and the parameters of SPGMs. A comparative empirical evaluation demonstrates competitive performances of our approach in density estimation.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06438
