Multivariate Density Modeling for Retirement Finance;Christopher J. Rook;Prior to the financial crisis mortgage securitization models increased in sophistication as did products built to insure against losses. Layers of complexity formed upon a foundation that could not support it and as the foundation crumbled the housing market followed. That foundation was the Gaussian copula which failed to correctly model failure-time correlations of derivative securities in duress. In retirement, surveys suggest the greatest fear is running out of money and as retirement decumulation models become increasingly sophisticated, large financial firms and robo-advisors may guarantee their success. Similar to an investment bank failure the event of retirement ruin is driven by outliers and correlations in times of stress. It would be desirable to have a foundation able to support the increased complexity before it forms however the industry currently relies upon similar Gaussian (or lognormal) dependence structures. We propose a multivariate density model having fixed marginals that is tractable and fits data which are skewed, heavy-tailed, multimodal, i.e., of arbitrary complexity allowing for a rich correlation structure. It is also ideal for stress-testing a retirement plan by fitting historical data seeded with black swan events. A preliminary section reviews all concepts before they are used and fully documented C/C++ source code is attached making the research self-contained. Lastly, we take the opportunity to challenge existing retirement finance dogma and also review some recent criticisms of retirement ruin probabilities and their suggested replacement metrics.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04070
FESTUNG: A MATLAB / GNU Octave toolbox for the discontinuous Galerkin method. Part II: Advection operator and slope limiting;Balthasar Reuter, Vadym Aizinger, Manuel Wieland, Florian Frank, Peter Knabner;This is the second in a series of papers on implementing a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method as an open source Matlab / GNU Octave toolbox. The intention of this ongoing project is to offer a rapid prototyping package for application development using DG methods. The implementation relies on fully vectorized matrix / vector operations and is comprehensively documented. Particular attention was paid to maintaining a direct mapping between discretization terms and code routines as well as to supporting the full code functionality in GNU Octave. The present work focuses on a two-dimensional time-dependent linear advection equation with space / time-varying coefficients, and provides a general order implementation of several slope limiting schemes for the DG method.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05754
FESTUNG: A MATLAB / GNU Octave toolbox for the discontinuous Galerkin method. Part I: Diffusion operator;Florian Frank, Balthasar Reuter, Vadym Aizinger, Peter Knabner;This is the first in a series of papers on implementing a discontinuous Galerkin method as a MATLAB / GNU Octave toolbox. The main goal is the development of techniques that deliver optimized computational performance combined with a compact, user-friendly interface. Our implementation relies on fully vectorized matrix / vector operations and is carefully documented  in addition, a direct mapping between discretization terms and code routines is maintained throughout. The present work focuses on a two-dimensional time-dependent diffusion equation with space / time-varying coefficients. The spatial discretization is based on the local discontinuous Galerkin formulation and is locally mass conservative. Approximations of orders zero through four based on orthogonal polynomials have been implemented  more spaces of arbitrary type and order can be easily accommodated by the code structure. Time discretization is performed using an implicit Euler method.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3877
A Modified Levy Jump-Diffusion Model Based on Market Sentiment Memory for Online Jump Prediction;Zheqing Zhu, Jian-guo Liu, Lei Li;In this paper, we propose a modified Levy jump diffusion model with market sentiment memory for stock prices, where the market sentiment comes from data mining implementation using Tweets on Twitter. We take the market sentiment process, which has memory, as the signal of Levy jumps in the stock price. An online learning and optimization algorithm with the Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is then proposed to learn the memory and to predict possible price jumps. Experiments show that the algorithm provides a relatively good performance in identifying asset return trends.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03611
Intelligent Subset Selection of Power Generators for Economic Dispatch;Biswarup Bhattacharya, Abhishek Sinha;Sustainable and economical generation of electrical power is an essential and mandatory component of infrastructure in today's world. Optimal generation (generator subset selection) of power requires a careful evaluation of various factors like type of source, generation, transmission & storage capacities, congestion among others which makes this a difficult task. We created a grid to simulate various conditions including stimuli like generator supply, weather and load demand using Siemens PSS/E software and this data is trained using deep learning methods and subsequently tested. The results are highly encouraging. As per our knowledge, this is the first paper to propose a working and scalable deep learning model for this problem.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02513
Tensor Representation in High-Frequency Financial Data for Price Change Prediction;Dat Tran Thanh, Juho Kanniainen, Moncef Gabbouj, Alexandros Iosifidis;Nowadays, with the availability of massive amount of trade data collected, the dynamics of the financial markets pose both a challenge and an opportunity for high frequency traders. In order to take advantage of the rapid, subtle movement of assets in High Frequency Trading (HFT), an automatic algorithm to analyze and detect patterns of price change based on transaction records must be available. The multichannel, time-series representation of financial data naturally suggests tensor-based learning algorithms. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of two multilinear methods for the mid-price prediction problem against other existing methods. The experiments in a large scale dataset which contains more than 4 millions limit orders show that by utilizing tensor representation, multilinear models outperform vector-based approaches and other competing ones.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01268
DR-RNN: A deep residual recurrent neural network for model reduction;J.Nagoor Kani, Ahmed H. Elsheikh;We introduce a deep residual recurrent neural network (DR-RNN) as an efficient model reduction technique for nonlinear dynamical systems. The developed DR-RNN is inspired by the iterative steps of line search methods in finding the residual minimiser of numerically discretized differential equations. We formulate this iterative scheme as stacked recurrent neural network (RNN) embedded with the dynamical structure of the emulated differential equations. Numerical examples demonstrate that DR-RNN can effectively emulate the full order models of nonlinear physical systems with a significantly lower number of parameters in comparison to standard RNN architectures. Further, we combined DR-RNN with Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for model reduction of time dependent partial differential equations. The presented numerical results show the stability of proposed DR-RNN as an explicit reduced order technique. We also show significant gains in accuracy by increasing the depth of proposed DR-RNN similar to other applications of deep learning.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00939
An accurate finite element method for the numerical solution of isothermal and incompressible flow of viscous fluid, part I: computational analysis;Bilen Emek Abali;An accurate finite element method for the numerical solution of isothermal and incompressible flow of viscous fluid, part I: computational analysis Bilen Emek Abali Despite the numerical challenges, finite element method is used for the simulation of viscous fluid flow. A consensus on the cause of numerical problems has been reached  however, general algorithms---allowing a robust and accurate simulation for any process---are still missing. Either a very high computational cost is necessary or some limiting procedure is used by adding artificial dissipation to the system such that the accuracy is in danger. As a means of achieving a reliable and accurate method independent on the underlying process, we attack the problem by starting a discussion about the admissible governing equations leading to the necessary weak form without use of any stabilization or splitting schemes. We implement and solve the weak form by using open-source packages and present the accuracy by comparing the simulation to the closed-form solutions in the case of a linear viscous fluid. The computational method is accurate and robust for simulating isothermal and incompressible flows.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00913
GPU-Accelerated Parallel Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method for Electromagnetic Waves Propagation in Unmagnetized Plasma Media;Xi-min Wang, Lang-lang Xiong, Song Liu, Zhi-yun Peng, Shuang-ying Zhong;The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method has been commonly utilized in the numerical solution of electromagnetic (EM) waves propagation through the plasma media. However, the FDTD method may bring about a significant increment in additional run-times consuming for computationally large and complicated EM problems. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computing based on Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) has grown in response to increased concern for reduction of run-times. We represent the CUDA-based FDTD method with the Runge-Kutta exponential time differencing scheme (RKETD) for the unmagnetized plasma implemented on GPU. In the paper, we derive the RKETD-FDTD formulation for the unmagnetized plasma comprehensively, and describe the detailed flowchart of CUDA-implemented RKETD-FDTD method on GPU. The accuracy and acceleration performance of the posed CUDA-based RKETD-FDTD method implemented on GPU are substantiated by the numerical experiment that simulates the EM waves traveling through the unmagnetized plasma slab, compared with merely CPU-based RKETD-FDTD method. The accuracy is validated by calculating the reflection and transmission coefficients for one-dimensional unmagnetized plasma slab. Comparison between the elapsed times of two methods proves that the GPU-based RKETD-FDTD method can acquire better application acceleration performance with sufficient accuracy.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00821
