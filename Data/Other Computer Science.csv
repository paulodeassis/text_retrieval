Computational prediction and analysis of protein-protein interaction networks;Somaye Hashemifar;Biological networks provide insight into the complex organization of biological processes in a cell at the system level. They are an effective tool for understanding the comprehensive map of functional interactions, finding the functional modules and pathways. Reconstruction and comparative analysis of these networks provide useful information to identify functional modules, prioritization of disease causing genes and also identification of drug targets. The talk will consist of two parts. I will discuss several methods for protein-protein interaction network alignment and investigate their preferences to other existing methods. Further, I briefly talk about reconstruction of protein-protein interaction networks by using deep learning.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01923
A Survey of Indoor Localization Systems and Technologies;Faheem Zafari, Athanasios Gkelias, Kin Leung;Indoor localization has recently witnessed an increase in interest, due to the potential wide range of services it can provide by leveraging Internet of Things (IoT), and ubiquitous connectivity. Different techniques, wireless technologies and mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to provide indoor localization services in order to improve the services provided to the users. However, there is a lack of an up-to-date survey paper that incorporates some of the recently proposed accurate and reliable localization systems. In this paper, we aim to provide a detailed survey of different indoor localization techniques such as Angle of Arrival (AoA), Time of Flight (ToF), Return Time of Flight (RTOF), Received Signal Strength (RSS) based on technologies such as WiFi, Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID), Ultra Wideband (UWB), Bluetooth and systems that have been proposed in the literature. The paper primarily discusses localization and positioning of human users and their devices. We highlight the strengths of the existing systems proposed in the literature. In contrast with the existing surveys, we also evaluate different systems from the perspective of energy efficiency, availability, cost, reception range, latency, scalability and tracking accuracy. Rather than comparing the technologies or techniques, we compare the localization systems and summarize their working principle. We also discuss remaining challenges to accurate indoor localization.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01015
D3NOC: Dynamic Data-Driven Network On Chip in Photonic Electronic Hybrids;Armin Mehrabian, Shuai Sun, Vikram K. Narayana, Volker J. Sorger, Tarek El-Ghazawi;In this paper, we present a reconfigurable hybrid Photonic-Plasmonic Network-on-Chip (NoC) based on the Dynamic Data Driven Application System (DDDAS) paradigm. In DDDAS computations and measurements form a dynamic closed feedback loop in which they tune one another in response to changes in the environment. Our proposed system enables dynamic augmentation of a base electrical mesh topology with an optical express bus during the run-time. In addition, the measurement process itself adjusts to the environment. In order to achieve lower latencies, lower dynamic power, and higher throughput, we take advantage of a Configurable Hybrid Photonic Plasmonic Interconnect (CHyPPI) for our reconfigurable connections. We evaluate the performance and power of our system against kernels from NAS Parallel Benchmark (NPB) in addition to some synthetically generated traffic. In comparison to a 16x16 base electrical mesh, D3NOC shows up to 89% latency and 67% dynamic power net improvements beyond overhead-corrected performance. It should be noted that the design-space of NoC reconfiguration is vast and the goal of this study is not design-space exploration. Our goal is to show the potentials of adaptive dynamic measurements when coupled with other reconfiguration techniques in the NoC context.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06721
SigViewer: Visualizing Multimodal Signals Stored in XDF (Extensible Data Format) Files;Yida Lin, Clemens Brunner, Paul Sajda, Josef Faller;Multimodal biosignal acquisition is facilitated by recently introduced software solutions such as LabStreaming Layer (LSL) and its associated data format XDF (Extensible Data Format). However, there are no stand-alone applications that can visualize multimodal time series stored in XDF files. We extended SigViewer, an open source cross-platform Qt C++ application with the capability of loading, resampling, annotating, and visualizing signals stored in XDF files and successfully applied the tool for post-hoc visual verification of the accuracy of a system that aims to predict the phase of alpha oscillations within the electroencephalogram in real-time.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06333
Neville's algorithm revisited;M. de Jong;Neville's algorithm is known to provide an efficient and numerically stable solution for polynomial interpolations. In this paper, an extension of this algorithm is presented which includes the derivatives of the interpolating polynomial.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06293
