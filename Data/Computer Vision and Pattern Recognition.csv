Review on Computer Vision Techniques in Emergency Situation;Laura Lopez-Fuentes, Joost van de Weijer, Manuel Gonzalez-Hidalgo, Harald Skinnemoen, Andrew D. Bagdanov;In emergency situations, actions that save lives and limit the impact of hazards are crucial. In order to act, situational awareness is needed to decide what to do. Geolocalized photos and video of the situations as they evolve can be crucial in better understanding them and making decisions faster. Cameras are almost everywhere these days, either in terms of smartphones, installed CCTV cameras, UAVs or others. However, this poses challenges in big data and information overflow. Moreover, most of the time there are no disasters at any given location, so humans aiming to detect sudden situations may not be as alert as needed at any point in time. Consequently, computer vision tools can be an excellent decision support. The number of emergencies where computer vision tools has been considered or used is very wide, and there is a great overlap across related emergency research. Researchers tend to focus on state-of-the-art systems that cover the same emergency as they are studying, obviating important research in other fields. In order to unveil this overlap, the survey is divided along four main axes: the types of emergencies that have been studied in computer vision, the objective that the algorithms can address, the type of hardware needed and the algorithms used. Therefore, this review provides a broad overview of the progress of computer vision covering all sorts of emergencies.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07455
Automatic Myocardial Segmentation by Using A Deep Learning Network in Cardiac MRI;Ariel H. Curiale, Flavio D. Colavecchia, Pablo Kaluza, Roberto A. Isoardi, German Mato;Cardiac function is of paramount importance for both prognosis and treatment of different pathologies such as mitral regurgitation, ischemia, dyssynchrony and myocarditis. Cardiac behavior is determined by structural and functional features. In both cases, the analysis of medical imaging studies requires to detect and segment the myocardium. Nowadays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most relevant and accurate non-invasive diagnostic tools for cardiac structure and function.;
Gradient-based Camera Exposure Control for Outdoor Mobile Platforms;Inwook Shim, Tae-Hyun Oh, Joon-Young Lee, Dong-Geol Choi, Jinwook Choi, In So Kweon;We introduce a novel method to automatically adjust camera exposure for image processing and computer vision applications of mobile robot platforms. Since most image processing algorithms heavily rely on low-level image features, which are largely based on local gradient information, we consider a gradient quantity to determine a proper exposure level, so that a camera is able to capture important image features robust to illumination conditions. We extend it to multi-camera system and present a new control algorithm to achieve both brightness consistency between adjacent cameras and a proper exposure level for each camera. We implement our prototype system with off-the-shelf machine vision cameras and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on practical applications: pedestrian detection, visual odometry, surround-view imaging, panoramic imaging, and stereo matching.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07338
Relaxed Spatio-Temporal Deep Feature Aggregation for Real-Fake Expression Prediction;Savas Ozkan, Gozde Bozdagi Akar;Frame-level visual features are generally aggregated in time with the techniques such as LSTM, Fisher Vectors, NetVLAD etc. to produce a robust video-level representation. We here introduce a learnable aggregation technique whose primary objective is to retain short-time temporal structure between frame-level features and their spatial interdependencies in the representation. Also, it can be easily adapted to the cases where there have very scarce training samples. We evaluate the method on a real-fake expression prediction dataset to demonstrate its superiority. Our method obtains 65% score on the test dataset in the official MAP evaluation and there is only one misclassified decision with the best reported result in the Chalearn Challenge (i.e. 66:7%) . Lastly, we believe that this method can be extended to different problems such as action/event recognition in future.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07335
Recent Advances in the Applications of Convolutional Neural Networks to Medical Image Contour Detection;Zizhao Zhang, Fuyong Xing, Hai Su, Xiaoshuang Shi, Lin Yang;The fast growing deep learning technologies have become the main solution of many machine learning problems for medical image analysis. Deep convolution neural networks (CNNs), as one of the most important branch of the deep learning family, have been widely investigated for various computer-aided diagnosis tasks including long-term problems and continuously emerging new problems. Image contour detection is a fundamental but challenging task that has been studied for more than four decades. Recently, we have witnessed the significantly improved performance of contour detection thanks to the development of CNNs. Beyond purusing performance in existing natural image benchmarks, contour detection plays a particularly important role in medical image analysis. Segmenting various objects from radiology images or pathology images requires accurate detection of contours. However, some problems, such as discontinuity and shape constraints, are insufficiently studied in CNNs. It is necessary to clarify the challenges to encourage further exploration. The performance of CNN based contour detection relies on the state-of-the-art CNN architectures. Careful investigation of their design principles and motivations is critical and beneficial to contour detection. In this paper, we first review recent development of medical image contour detection and point out the current confronting challenges and problems. We discuss the development of general CNNs and their applications in image contours (or edges) detection. We compare those methods in detail, clarify their strengthens and weaknesses. Then we review their recent applications in medical image analysis and point out limitations, with the goal to light some potential directions in medical image analysis. We expect the paper to cover comprehensive technical ingredients of advanced CNNs to enrich the study in the medical image domain.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07281
3D Morphable Models as Spatial Transformer Networks;Anil Bas, Patrik Huber, William A. P. Smith, Muhammad Awais, Josef Kittler;In this paper, we show how a 3D Morphable Model (i.e. a statistical model of the 3D shape of a class of objects such as faces) can be used to spatially transform input data as a module (a 3DMM-STN) within a convolutional neural network. This is an extension of the original spatial transformer network in that we are able to interpret and normalise 3D pose changes and self-occlusions. The trained localisation part of the network is independently useful since it learns to fit a 3D morphable model to a single image. We show that the localiser can be trained using only simple geometric loss functions on a relatively small dataset yet is able to perform robust normalisation on highly uncontrolled images including occlusion, self-occlusion and large pose changes.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07199
Learning Grasping Interaction with Geometry-aware 3D Representations;Xinchen Yan, Mohi Khansari, Yunfei Bai, Jasmine Hsu, Arkanath Pathak, Arbhinav Gupta, James Davidson, Honglak Lee;Learning to interact with objects in the environment is a fundamental AI problem involving perception, motion planning, and control. However, learning representations of such interactions is very challenging due to a high dimensional state space, difficulty in collecting large-scale data, and many variations of an object's visual appearance (i.e. geometry, material, texture, and illumination). We argue that knowledge of 3D geometry is at the heart of grasping interactions and propose the notion of a geometry-aware learning agent. Our key idea is constraining and regularizing interaction learning through 3D geometry prediction. Specifically, we formulate the learning process of a geometry-aware agent as a two-step procedure: First, the agent learns to construct its geometry-aware representation of the scene from 2D sensory input via generative 3D shape modeling. Finally, it learns to predict grasping outcome with its built-in geometry-aware representation. The geometry-aware representation plays a key role in relating geometry and interaction via a novel learning-free depth projection layer. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we build a grasping dataset from demonstrations in virtual reality (VR) with rich sensory and interaction annotations (2) we demonstrate that the learned geometry-aware representation results in a more robust grasping outcome prediction compared to a baseline model and (3) we demonstrate the benefits of the learned geometry-aware representation in grasping planning.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07303
An Image Analysis Approach to the Calligraphy of Books;Henrique F. de Arruda, Vanessa Q. Marinho, Thales S. Lima, Diego R. Amancio, Luciano da F. Costa;Text network analysis has received increasing attention as a consequence of its wide range of applications. In this work, we extend a previous work founded on the study of topological features of mesoscopic networks. Here, the geometrical properties of visualized networks are quantified in terms of several image analysis techniques and used as subsidies for authorship attribution. It was found that the visual features account for performance similar to that achieved by using topological measurements. In addition, the combination of these two types of features improved the performance.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07265
Predicting Aesthetic Score Distribution through Cumulative Jensen-Shannon Divergence;Xin Jin, Le Wu, Chenggen Song, Xiaodong Li, Geng Zhao, Siyu Chen, Jingying Chi, Siwei Peng, Shiming Ge;Aesthetic quality prediction is a challenging task in the computer vision community because of the complex interplay with semantic contents and photographic technologies. Recent studies on the powerful deep learning based aesthetic quality assessment usually use a binary high-low label or a numerical score to represent the aesthetic quality. However the scalar representation cannot describe well the underlying varieties of the human perception of aesthetics. In this work, we propose to predict the aesthetic score distribution (i.e., a score distribution vector of the ordinal basic human ratings) using Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). Conventional DCNNs which aim to minimize the difference between the predicted scalar numbers or vectors and the ground truth cannot be directly used for the ordinal basic rating distribution. Thus, a novel CNN based on the Cumulative distribution with Jensen-Shannon divergence (CJS-CNN) is presented to predict the aesthetic score distribution of human ratings, with a new reliability-sensitive learning method based on the kurtosis of the score distribution. Experimental results on large scale aesthetic dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our introduced CJS-CNN in this task. In addition, by recasting the predicted score histogram to a binary score using the mean value and a relative small scale CNN, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on aesthetic image classification.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07089
Single Reference Image based Scene Relighting via Material Guided Filtering;Xin Jin, Yannan Li, Ningning Liu, Xiaodong Li, Xianggang Jiang, Chaoen Xiao, Shiming Ge;Image relighting is to change the illumination of an image to a target illumination effect without known the original scene geometry, material information and illumination condition. We propose a novel outdoor scene relighting method, which needs only a single reference image and is based on material constrained layer decomposition. Firstly, the material map is extracted from the input image. Then, the reference image is warped to the input image through patch match based image warping. Lastly, the input image is relit using material constrained layer decomposition. The experimental results reveal that our method can produce similar illumination effect as that of the reference image on the input image using only a single reference image.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07066
Non-linear Convolution Filters for CNN-based Learning;Georgios Zoumpourlis, Alexandros Doumanoglou, Nicholas Vretos, Petros Daras;During the last years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image classification. Their architectures have largely drawn inspiration by models of the primate visual system. However, while recent research results of neuroscience prove the existence of non-linear operations in the response of complex visual cells, little effort has been devoted to extend the convolution technique to non-linear forms. Typical convolutional layers are linear systems, hence their expressiveness is limited. To overcome this, various non-linearities have been used as activation functions inside CNNs, while also many pooling strategies have been applied. We address the issue of developing a convolution method in the context of a computational model of the visual cortex, exploring quadratic forms through the Volterra kernels. Such forms, constituting a more rich function space, are used as approximations of the response profile of visual cells. Our proposed second-order convolution is tested on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. We show that a network which combines linear and non-linear filters in its convolutional layers, can outperform networks that use standard linear filters with the same architecture, yielding results competitive with the state-of-the-art on these datasets.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07038
Application of a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification to the analysis of collisions in High Energy Physics;Celia Fern醤dez Madrazo, Ignacio Heredia Cacha, Lara Lloret Iglesias, Jes鷖 Marco de Lucas;The application of deep learning techniques using convolutional neural networks to the classification of particle collisions in High Energy Physics is explored. An intuitive approach to transform physical variables, like momenta of particles and jets, into a single image that captures the relevant information, is proposed. The idea is tested using a well known deep learning framework on a simulation dataset, including leptonic ttbar events and the corresponding background at 7 TeV from the CMS experiment at LHC, available as Open Data. This initial test shows competitive results when compared to more classical approaches, like those using feedforward neural networks.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07034
Fast single image super-resolution based on sigmoid transformation;Longguang Wang, Zaiping Lin, Jinyan Gao, Xinpu Deng, Wei An;Single image super-resolution aims to generate a high-resolution image from a single low-resolution image, which is of great importance in extensive applications. As an ill-posed problem, numerous methods have been proposed to reconstruct the missing image details based on exemplars or priors. In this paper, we propose a fast and simple single image super-resolution strategy utilizing patch-wise sigmoid transformation as an imposed sharpening regularization term in the backprojection, which realizes amazing reconstruction effect. Extensive experiments compared with other state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07029
CNN-Based Prediction of Frame-Level Shot Importance for Video Summarization;Mohaiminul Al Nahian, A. S. M. Iftekhar, Mohammad Tariqul Islam, S. M. Mahbubur Rahman, Dimitrios Hatzinakos;In the Internet, ubiquitous presence of redundant, unedited, raw videos has made video summarization an important problem. Traditional methods of video summarization employ a heuristic set of hand-crafted features, which in many cases fail to capture subtle abstraction of a scene. This paper presents a deep learning method that maps the context of a video to the importance of a scene similar to that is perceived by humans. In particular, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based architecture is proposed to mimic the frame-level shot importance for user-oriented video summarization. The weights and biases of the CNN are trained extensively through off-line processing, so that it can provide the importance of a frame of an unseen video almost instantaneously. Experiments on estimating the shot importance is carried out using the publicly available database TVSum50. It is shown that the performance of the proposed network is substantially better than that of commonly referred feature-based methods for estimating the shot importance in terms of mean absolute error, absolute error variance, and relative F-measure.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07023
Statistical Selection of CNN-Based Audiovisual Features for Instantaneous Estimation of Human Emotional States;Ramesh Basnet, Mohammad Tariqul Islam, Tamanna Howlader, S. M. Mahbubur Rahman, Dimitrios Hatzinakos;Automatic prediction of continuous-level emotional state requires selection of suitable affective features to develop a regression system based on supervised machine learning. This paper investigates the performance of features statistically learned using convolutional neural networks for instantaneously predicting the continuous dimensions of emotional states. Features with minimum redundancy and maximum relevancy are chosen by using the mutual information-based selection process. The performance of frame-by-frame prediction of emotional state using the moderate length features as proposed in this paper is evaluated on spontaneous and naturalistic human-human conversation of RECOLA database. Experimental results show that the proposed model can be used for instantaneous prediction of emotional state with an accuracy higher than traditional audio or video features that are used for affective computation.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07021
The Unconstrained Ear Recognition Challenge;巌ga Emer歩?, Dejan 妕epec, Vitomir 妕ruc, Peter Peer, Anjith George, Adil Ahmad, Elshibani Omar, Terrance E. Boult, Reza Safdari, Yuxiang Zhou, Stefanos Zafeiriou, Dogucan Yaman, Fevziye I. Eyiokur, Hazim K. Ekenel;In this paper we present the results of the Unconstrained Ear Recognition Challenge (UERC), a group benchmarking effort centered around the problem of person recognition from ear images captured in uncontrolled conditions. The goal of the challenge was to assess the performance of existing ear recognition techniques on a challenging large-scale dataset and identify open problems that need to be addressed in the future. Five groups from three continents participated in the challenge and contributed six ear recognition techniques for the evaluation, while multiple baselines were made available for the challenge by the UERC organizers. A comprehensive analysis was conducted with all participating approaches addressing essential research questions pertaining to the sensitivity of the technology to head rotation, flipping, gallery size, large-scale recognition and others. The top performer of the UERC was found to ensure robust performance on a smaller part of the dataset (with 180 subjects) regardless of image characteristics, but still exhibited a significant performance drop when the entire dataset comprising 3,704 subjects was used for testing.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06997
Incremental Learning of Object Detectors without Catastrophic Forgetting;Konstantin Shmelkov, Cordelia Schmid, Karteek Alahari;"Despite their success for object detection, convolutional neural networks are ill-equipped for incremental learning, i.e., adapting the original model trained on a set of classes to additionally detect objects of new classes, in the absence of the initial training data. They suffer from ""catastrophic forgetting"" - an abrupt degradation of performance on the original set of classes, when the training objective is adapted to the new classes. We present a method to address this issue, and learn object detectors incrementally, when neither the original training data nor annotations for the original classes in the new training set are available. The core of our proposed solution is a loss function to balance the interplay between predictions on the new classes and a new distillation loss which minimizes the discrepancy between responses for old classes from the original and the updated networks. This incremental learning can be performed multiple times, for a new set of classes in each step, with a moderate drop in performance compared to the baseline network trained on the ensemble of data. We present object detection results on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and COCO datasets, along with a detailed empirical analysis of the approach.";https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06977
Generating Visual Representations for Zero-Shot Classification;Maxime Bucher (1), St閜hane Herbin (1), Fr閐閞ic Jurie ((1) Palaiseau);This paper addresses the task of learning an image clas-sifier when some categories are defined by semantic descriptions only (e.g. visual attributes) while the others are defined by exemplar images as well. This task is often referred to as the Zero-Shot classification task (ZSC). Most of the previous methods rely on learning a common embedding space allowing to compare visual features of unknown categories with semantic descriptions. This paper argues that these approaches are limited as i) efficient discrimi-native classifiers can't be used ii) classification tasks with seen and unseen categories (Generalized Zero-Shot Classification or GZSC) can't be addressed efficiently. In contrast , this paper suggests to address ZSC and GZSC by i) learning a conditional generator using seen classes ii) generate artificial training examples for the categories without exemplars. ZSC is then turned into a standard supervised learning problem. Experiments with 4 generative models and 5 datasets experimentally validate the approach, giving state-of-the-art results on both ZSC and GZSC.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06975
Exploiting Convolution Filter Patterns for Transfer Learning;Mehmet Ayg黱, Yusuf Aytar, Haz?m Kemal Ekenel;In this paper, we introduce a new regularization technique for transfer learning. The aim of the proposed approach is to capture statistical relationships among convolution filters learned from a well-trained network and transfer this knowledge to another network. Since convolution filters of the prevalent deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models share a number of similar patterns, in order to speed up the learning procedure, we capture such correlations by Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and transfer them using a regularization term. We have conducted extensive experiments on the CIFAR10, Places2, and CMPlaces datasets to assess generalizability, task transferability, and cross-model transferability of the proposed approach, respectively. The experimental results show that the feature representations have efficiently been learned and transferred through the proposed statistical regularization scheme. Moreover, our method is an architecture independent approach, which is applicable for a variety of CNN architectures.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06973
In search of inliers: 3d correspondence by local and global voting;Anders Glent Buch, Yang Yang, Norbert Kr黦er, Henrik Gordon Petersen;We present a method for finding correspondence between 3D models. From an initial set of feature correspondences, our method uses a fast voting scheme to separate the inliers from the outliers. The novelty of our method lies in the use of a combination of local and global constraints to determine if a vote should be cast. On a local scale, we use simple, low-level geometric invariants. On a global scale, we apply covariant constraints for finding compatible correspondences. We guide the sampling for collecting voters by downward dependencies on previous voting stages. All of this together results in an accurate matching procedure. We evaluate our algorithm by controlled and comparative testing on different datasets, giving superior performance compared to state of the art methods. In a final experiment, we apply our method for 3D object detection, showing potential use of our method within higher-level vision.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06966
Pose Estimation using Local Structure-Specific Shape and Appearance Context;Anders Glent Buch, Dirk Kraft, Joni-Kristian Kamarainen, Henrik Gordon Petersen, Norbert Kr黦er;We address the problem of estimating the alignment pose between two models using structure-specific local descriptors. Our descriptors are generated using a combination of 2D image data and 3D contextual shape data, resulting in a set of semi-local descriptors containing rich appearance and shape information for both edge and texture structures. This is achieved by defining feature space relations which describe the neighborhood of a descriptor. By quantitative evaluations, we show that our descriptors provide high discriminative power compared to state of the art approaches. In addition, we show how to utilize this for the estimation of the alignment pose between two point sets. We present experiments both in controlled and real-life scenarios to validate our approach.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06963
Multiple-Kernel Based Vehicle Tracking Using 3D Deformable Model and Camera Self-Calibration;Zheng Tang, Gaoang Wang, Tao Liu, Young-Gun Lee, Adwin Jahn, Xu Liu, Xiaodong He, Jenq-Neng Hwang;Tracking of multiple objects is an important application in AI City geared towards solving salient problems related to safety and congestion in an urban environment. Frequent occlusion in traffic surveillance has been a major problem in this research field. In this challenge, we propose a model-based vehicle localization method, which builds a kernel at each patch of the 3D deformable vehicle model and associates them with constraints in 3D space. The proposed method utilizes shape fitness evaluation besides color information to track vehicle objects robustly and efficiently. To build 3D car models in a fully unsupervised manner, we also implement evolutionary camera self-calibration from tracking of walking humans to automatically compute camera parameters. Additionally, the segmented foreground masks which are crucial to 3D modeling and camera self-calibration are adaptively refined by multiple-kernel feedback from tracking. For object detection/classification, the state-of-the-art single shot multibox detector (SSD) is adopted to train and test on the NVIDIA AI City Dataset. To improve the accuracy on categories with only few objects, like bus, bicycle and motorcycle, we also employ the pretrained model from YOLO9000 with multi-scale testing. We combine the results from SSD and YOLO9000 based on ensemble learning. Experiments show that our proposed tracking system outperforms both state-of-the-art of tracking by segmentation and tracking by detection.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06831
Deep EndoVO: A Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) based Visual Odometry Approach for Endoscopic Capsule Robots;Mehmet Turan, Yasin Almalioglu, Helder Araujo, Ender Konukoglu, Metin Sitti;Ingestible wireless capsule endoscopy is an emerging minimally invasive diagnostic technology for inspection of the GI tract and diagnosis of a wide range of diseases and pathologies. Medical device companies and many research groups have recently made substantial progresses in converting passive capsule endoscopes to active capsule robots, enabling more accurate, precise, and intuitive detection of the location and size of the diseased areas. Since a reliable real time pose estimation functionality is crucial for actively controlled endoscopic capsule robots, in this study, we propose a monocular visual odometry (VO) method for endoscopic capsule robot operations. Our method lies on the application of the deep Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNNs) for the visual odometry task, where Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are used for the feature extraction and inference of dynamics across the frames, respectively. Detailed analyses and evaluations made on a real pig stomach dataset proves that our system achieves high translational and rotational accuracies for different types of endoscopic capsule robot trajectories.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06822
Human Action Recognition System using Good Features and Multilayer Perceptron Network;Jonti Talukdar, Bhavana Mehta;Human action recognition involves the characterization of human actions through the automated analysis of video data and is integral in the development of smart computer vision systems. However, several challenges like dynamic backgrounds, camera stabilization, complex actions, occlusions etc. make action recognition in a real time and robust fashion difficult. Several complex approaches exist but are computationally intensive. This paper presents a novel approach of using a combination of good features along with iterative optical flow algorithm to compute feature vectors which are classified using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network. The use of multiple features for motion descriptors enhances the quality of tracking. Resilient backpropagation algorithm is used for training the feedforward neural network reducing the learning time. The overall system accuracy is improved by optimizing the various parameters of the multilayer perceptron network.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06794
Reflection Separation and Deblurring of Plenoptic Images;Paramanand Chandramouli, Mehdi Noroozi, Paolo Favaro;In this paper, we address the problem of reflection removal and deblurring from a single image captured by a plenoptic camera. We develop a two-stage approach to recover the scene depth and high resolution textures of the reflected and transmitted layers. For depth estimation in the presence of reflections, we train a classifier through convolutional neural networks. For recovering high resolution textures, we assume that the scene is composed of planar regions and perform the reconstruction of each layer by using an explicit form of the plenoptic camera point spread function. The proposed framework also recovers the sharp scene texture with different motion blurs applied to each layer. We demonstrate our method on challenging real and synthetic images.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06779
