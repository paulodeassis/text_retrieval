Area Protection in Adversarial Path-Finding Scenarios with Multiple Mobile Agents on Graphs: a theoretical and experimental study of target-allocation strategies for defense coordination;Marika Ivanov√°, Pavel Surynek;We address a problem of area protection in graph-based scenarios with multiple agents. The problem consists of two adversarial teams of agents that move in an undirected graph shared by both teams. Agents are placed in vertices of the graph at most one agent can occupy a vertex and they can move into adjacent vertices in a conflict free way. Teams have asymmetric goals: the aim of one team - attackers - is to invade into given area while the aim of the opponent team - defenders - is to protect the area from being entered by attackers by occupying selected vertices. We study strategies for allocating vertices to be occupied by the team of defenders to block attacking agents. We show that the decision version of the problem of area protection is PSPACE-hard under the assumption that agents can allocate their target vertices multiple times. Further we develop various on-line vertex-allocation strategies for the defender team in a simplified variant of the problem with single stage vertex allocation and evaluated their performance in multiple benchmarks. The success of a strategy is heavily dependent on the type of the instance, and so one of the contributions of this work is that we identify suitable vertex-allocation strategies for diverse instance types. In particular, we introduce a simulation-based method that identifies and tries to capture bottlenecks in the graph, that are frequently used by the attackers. Our experimental evaluation suggests that this method often allows a successful defense even in instances where the attackers significantly outnumber the defenders.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07285
Learning Generalized Reactive Policies using Deep Neural Networks;Edward Groshev, Aviv Tamar, Siddharth Srivastava, Pieter Abbeel;We consider the problem of learning for planning, where knowledge acquired while planning is reused to plan faster in new problem instances. For robotic tasks, among others, plan execution can be captured as a sequence of visual images. For such domains, we propose to use deep neural networks in learning for planning, based on learning a reactive policy that imitates execution traces produced by a planner. We investigate architectural properties of deep networks that are suitable for learning long-horizon planning behavior, and explore how to learn, in addition to the policy, a heuristic function that can be used with classical planners or search algorithms such as A*. Our results on the challenging Sokoban domain show that, with a suitable network design, complex decision making policies and powerful heuristic functions can be learned through imitation.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07280
Finding Streams in Knowledge Graphs to Support Fact Checking;Prashant Shiralkar, Alessandro Flammini, Filippo Menczer, Giovanni Luca Ciampaglia;"The volume and velocity of information that gets generated online limits current journalistic practices to fact-check claims at the same rate. Computational approaches for fact checking may be the key to help mitigate the risks of massive misinformation spread. Such approaches can be designed to not only be scalable and effective at assessing veracity of dubious claims, but also to boost a human fact checker's productivity by surfacing relevant facts and patterns to aid their analysis. To this end, we present a novel, unsupervised network-flow based approach to determine the truthfulness of a statement of fact expressed in the form of a (subject, predicate, object) triple. We view a knowledge graph of background information about real-world entities as a flow network, and knowledge as a fluid, abstract commodity. We show that computational fact checking of such a triple then amounts to finding a ""knowledge stream"" that emanates from the subject node and flows toward the object node through paths connecting them. Evaluation on a range of real-world and hand-crafted datasets of facts related to entertainment, business, sports, geography and more reveals that this network-flow model can be very effective in discerning true statements from false ones, outperforming existing algorithms on many test cases. Moreover, the model is expressive in its ability to automatically discover several useful path patterns and surface relevant facts that may help a human fact checker corroborate or refute a claim.";https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07239
A Survey of Human Activity Recognition Using WiFi CSI;Siamak Yousefi, Hirokazu Narui, Sankalp Dayal, Stefano Ermon, Shahrokh Valaee;In this article, we present a survey of recent advances in passive human behaviour recognition in indoor areas using the channel state information (CSI) of commercial WiFi systems. Movement of human body causes a change in the wireless signal reflections, which results in variations in the CSI. By analyzing the data streams of CSIs for different activities and comparing them against stored models, human behaviour can be recognized. This is done by extracting features from CSI data streams and using machine learning techniques to build models and classifiers. The techniques from the literature that are presented herein have great performances, however, instead of the machine learning techniques employed in these works, we propose to use deep learning techniques such as long-short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN), and show the improved performance. We also discuss about different challenges such as environment change, frame rate selection, and multi-user scenario, and suggest possible directions for future work.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07129
Learning Grasping Interaction with Geometry-aware 3D Representations;Xinchen Yan, Mohi Khansari, Yunfei Bai, Jasmine Hsu, Arkanath Pathak, Arbhinav Gupta, James Davidson, Honglak Lee;Learning to interact with objects in the environment is a fundamental AI problem involving perception, motion planning, and control. However, learning representations of such interactions is very challenging due to a high dimensional state space, difficulty in collecting large-scale data, and many variations of an object's visual appearance (i.e. geometry, material, texture, and illumination). We argue that knowledge of 3D geometry is at the heart of grasping interactions and propose the notion of a geometry-aware learning agent. Our key idea is constraining and regularizing interaction learning through 3D geometry prediction. Specifically, we formulate the learning process of a geometry-aware agent as a two-step procedure: First, the agent learns to construct its geometry-aware representation of the scene from 2D sensory input via generative 3D shape modeling. Finally, it learns to predict grasping outcome with its built-in geometry-aware representation. The geometry-aware representation plays a key role in relating geometry and interaction via a novel learning-free depth projection layer. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we build a grasping dataset from demonstrations in virtual reality (VR) with rich sensory and interaction annotations (2) we demonstrate that the learned geometry-aware representation results in a more robust grasping outcome prediction compared to a baseline model and (3) we demonstrate the benefits of the learned geometry-aware representation in grasping planning.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07303
A Study on Neural Network Language Modeling;Dengliang Shi;An exhaustive study on neural network language modeling (NNLM) is performed in this paper. Different architectures of basic neural network language models are described and examined. A number of different improvements over basic neural network language models, including importance sampling, word classes, caching and bidirectional recurrent neural network (BiRNN), are studied separately, and the advantages and disadvantages of every technique are evaluated. Then, the limits of neural network language modeling are explored from the aspects of model architecture and knowledge representation. Part of the statistical information from a word sequence will loss when it is processed word by word in a certain order, and the mechanism of training neural network by updating weight matrixes and vectors imposes severe restrictions on any significant enhancement of NNLM. For knowledge representation, the knowledge represented by neural network language models is the approximate probabilistic distribution of word sequences from a certain training data set rather than the knowledge of a language itself or the information conveyed by word sequences in a natural language. Finally, some directions for improving neural network language modeling further is discussed.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07252
On the Compressive Power of Deep Rectifier Networks for High Resolution Representation of Class Boundaries;Senjian An, Mohammed Bennamoun, Farid Boussaid;"This paper provides a theoretical justification of the superior classification performance of deep rectifier networks over shallow rectifier networks from the geometrical perspective of piecewise linear (PWL) classifier boundaries. We show that, for a given threshold on the approximation error, the required number of boundary facets to approximate a general smooth boundary grows exponentially with the dimension of the data, and thus the number of boundary facets, referred to as boundary resolution, of a PWL classifier is an important quality measure that can be used to estimate a lower bound on the classification errors. However, learning naively an exponentially large number of boundary facets requires the determination of an exponentially large number of parameters and also requires an exponentially large number of training patterns. To overcome this issue of ""curse of dimensionality"", compressive representations of high resolution classifier boundaries are required. To show the superior compressive power of deep rectifier networks over shallow rectifier networks, we prove that the maximum boundary resolution of a single hidden layer rectifier network classifier grows exponentially with the number of units when this number is smaller than the dimension of the patterns. When the number of units is larger than the dimension of the patterns, the growth rate is reduced to a polynomial order. Consequently, the capacity of generating a high resolution boundary will increase if the same large number of units are arranged in multiple layers instead of a single hidden layer. Taking high dimensional spherical boundaries as examples, we show how deep rectifier networks can utilize geometric symmetries to approximate a boundary with the same accuracy but with a significantly fewer number of parameters than single hidden layer nets.";https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07244
Towards an Automatic Turing Test: Learning to Evaluate Dialogue Responses;Ryan Lowe, Michael Noseworthy, Iulian V. Serban, Nicolas Angelard-Gontier, Yoshua Bengio, Joelle Pineau;Automatically evaluating the quality of dialogue responses for unstructured domains is a challenging problem. Unfortunately, existing automatic evaluation metrics are biased and correlate very poorly with human judgements of response quality. Yet having an accurate automatic evaluation procedure is crucial for dialogue research, as it allows rapid prototyping and testing of new models with fewer expensive human evaluations. In response to this challenge, we formulate automatic dialogue evaluation as a learning problem. We present an evaluation model (ADEM) that learns to predict human-like scores to input responses, using a new dataset of human response scores. We show that the ADEM model's predictions correlate significantly, and at a level much higher than word-overlap metrics such as BLEU, with human judgements at both the utterance and system-level. We also show that ADEM can generalize to evaluating dialogue models unseen during training, an important step for automatic dialogue evaluation.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07149
On Relaxing Determinism in Arithmetic Circuits;Arthur Choi, Adnan Darwiche;The past decade has seen a significant interest in learning tractable probabilistic representations. Arithmetic circuits (ACs) were among the first proposed tractable representations, with some subsequent representations being instances of ACs with weaker or stronger properties. In this paper, we provide a formal basis under which variants on ACs can be compared, and where the precise roles and semantics of their various properties can be made more transparent. This allows us to place some recent developments on ACs in a clearer perspective and to also derive new results for ACs. This includes an exponential separation between ACs with and without determinism completeness and incompleteness results and tractability results (or lack thereof) when computing most probable explanations (MPEs).;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06846
Skip RNN: Learning to Skip State Updates in Recurrent Neural Networks;Victor Campos, Brendan Jou, Xavier Giro-i-Nieto, Jordi Torres, Shih-Fu Chang;Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) continue to show outstanding performance in sequence modeling tasks. However, training RNNs on long sequences often face challenges like slow inference, vanishing gradients and difficulty in capturing long term dependencies. In backpropagation through time settings, these issues are tightly coupled with the large, sequential computational graph resulting from unfolding the RNN in time. We introduce the Skip RNN model which extends existing RNN models by learning to skip state updates and shortens the effective size of the computational graph. This model can also be encouraged to perform fewer state updates through a budget constraint. We evaluate the proposed model on various tasks and show how it can reduce the number of required RNN updates while preserving, and sometimes even improving, the performance of the baseline RNN models.

Analysis of the Impact of Negative Sampling on Link Prediction in Knowledge Graphs;Bhushan Kotnis, Vivi Nastase;"Knowledge graphs are large, useful, but incomplete knowledge repositories. They encode knowledge through entities and relations which define each other through the connective structure of the graph. This has inspired methods for the joint embedding of entities and relations in continuous low-dimensional vector spaces, that can be used to induce new edges in the graph, i.e., link prediction in knowledge graphs. Learning these representations relies on contrasting positive instances with negative ones. Knowledge graphs include only positive relation instances, leaving the door open for a variety of methods for selecting negative examples. In this paper we present an empirical study on the impact of negative sampling on the learned embeddings, assessed through the task of link prediction. We use state-of-the-art knowledge graph embeddings -- \rescal , TransE, DistMult and ComplEX -- and evaluate on benchmark datasets -- FB15k and WN18. We compare well known methods for negative sampling and additionally propose embedding based sampling methods. We note a marked difference in the impact of these sampling methods on the two datasets, with the ""traditional"" corrupting positives method leading to best results on WN18, while embedding based methods benefiting the task on FB15k.";https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06816
Capturing Long-term Temporal Dependencies with Convolutional Networks for Continuous Emotion Recognition;Soheil Khorram, Zakaria Aldeneh, Dimitrios Dimitriadis, Melvin McInnis, Emily Mower Provost;The goal of continuous emotion recognition is to assign an emotion value to every frame in a sequence of acoustic features. We show that incorporating long-term temporal dependencies is critical for continuous emotion recognition tasks. To this end, we first investigate architectures that use dilated convolutions. We show that even though such architectures outperform previously reported systems, the output signals produced from such architectures undergo erratic changes between consecutive time steps. This is inconsistent with the slow moving ground-truth emotion labels that are obtained from human annotators. To deal with this problem, we model a downsampled version of the input signal and then generate the output signal through upsampling. Not only does the resulting downsampling/upsampling network achieve good performance, it also generates smooth output trajectories. Our method yields the best known audio-only performance on the RECOLA dataset.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07050
Non-linear Convolution Filters for CNN-based Learning;Georgios Zoumpourlis, Alexandros Doumanoglou, Nicholas Vretos, Petros Daras;During the last years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image classification. Their architectures have largely drawn inspiration by models of the primate visual system. However, while recent research results of neuroscience prove the existence of non-linear operations in the response of complex visual cells, little effort has been devoted to extend the convolution technique to non-linear forms. Typical convolutional layers are linear systems, hence their expressiveness is limited. To overcome this, various non-linearities have been used as activation functions inside CNNs, while also many pooling strategies have been applied. We address the issue of developing a convolution method in the context of a computational model of the visual cortex, exploring quadratic forms through the Volterra kernels. Such forms, constituting a more rich function space, are used as approximations of the response profile of visual cells. Our proposed second-order convolution is tested on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. We show that a network which combines linear and non-linear filters in its convolutional layers, can outperform networks that use standard linear filters with the same architecture, yielding results competitive with the state-of-the-art on these datasets.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07038
A Neural Network Approach for Mixing Language Models;Youssef Oualil, Dietrich Klakow;The performance of Neural Network (NN)-based language models is steadily improving due to the emergence of new architectures, which are able to learn different natural language characteristics. This paper presents a novel framework, which shows that a significant improvement can be achieved by combining different existing heterogeneous models in a single architecture. This is done through 1) a feature layer, which separately learns different NN-based models and 2) a mixture layer, which merges the resulting model features. In doing so, this architecture benefits from the learning capabilities of each model with no noticeable increase in the number of model parameters or the training time. Extensive experiments conducted on the Penn Treebank (PTB) and the Large Text Compression Benchmark (LTCB) corpus showed a significant reduction of the perplexity when compared to state-of-the-art feedforward as well as recurrent neural network architectures.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06989
Paving the Roadway for Safety of Automated Vehicles: An Empirical Study on Testing Challenges;Alessia Knauss, Jan Schr√∂der, Christian Berger, Henrik Eriksson;The technology in the area of automated vehicles is gaining speed and promises many advantages. However, with the recent introduction of conditionally automated driving, we have also seen accidents. Test protocols for both, conditionally automated (e.g., on highways) and automated vehicles do not exist yet and leave researchers and practitioners with different challenges. For instance, current test procedures do not suffice for fully automated vehicles, which are supposed to be completely in charge for the driving task and have no driver as a back up. This paper presents current challenges of testing the functionality and safety of automated vehicles derived from conducting focus groups and interviews with 26 participants from five countries having a background related to testing automotive safety-related topics.We provide an overview of the state-of-practice of testing active safety features as well as challenges that needs to be addressed in the future to ensure safety for automated vehicles. The major challenges identified through the interviews and focus groups, enriched by literature on this topic are related to 1) virtual testing and simulation, 2) safety, reliability, and quality, 3) sensors and sensor models, 4) required scenario complexity and amount of test cases, and 5) handover of responsibility between the driver and the vehicle.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06988
Generating Visual Representations for Zero-Shot Classification;Maxime Bucher (1), St√©phane Herbin (1), Fr√©d√©ric Jurie ((1) Palaiseau);This paper addresses the task of learning an image clas-sifier when some categories are defined by semantic descriptions only (e.g. visual attributes) while the others are defined by exemplar images as well. This task is often referred to as the Zero-Shot classification task (ZSC). Most of the previous methods rely on learning a common embedding space allowing to compare visual features of unknown categories with semantic descriptions. This paper argues that these approaches are limited as i) efficient discrimi-native classifiers can't be used ii) classification tasks with seen and unseen categories (Generalized Zero-Shot Classification or GZSC) can't be addressed efficiently. In contrast , this paper suggests to address ZSC and GZSC by i) learning a conditional generator using seen classes ii) generate artificial training examples for the categories without exemplars. ZSC is then turned into a standard supervised learning problem. Experiments with 4 generative models and 5 datasets experimentally validate the approach, giving state-of-the-art results on both ZSC and GZSC.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06975
The Reachability of Computer Programs;Reginaldo I. Silva Filho, Ricardo L. Azevedo da Rocha, Camila Leite Silva, Ricardo H. Gracini Guiraldelli;Would it be possible to explain the emergence of new computational ideas using the computation itself? Would it be feasible to describe the discovery process of new algorithmic solutions using only mathematics? This study is the first effort to analyze the nature of such inquiry from the viewpoint of effort to find a new algorithmic solution to a given problem. We define program reachability as a probability function whose argument is a form of the energetic cost (algorithmic entropy) of the problem.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06877
Anytime Neural Networks via Joint Optimization of Auxiliary Losses;Hanzhang Hu, Debadeepta Dey, J. Andrew Bagnell, Martial Hebert;We address the problem of anytime prediction in neural networks. An anytime predictor automatically adjusts to and utilizes available test-time budget: it produces a crude initial result quickly and continuously refines the result afterwards. Traditional feed-forward networks achieve state-of-the-art performance on many machine learning tasks, but cannot produce anytime predictions during their typically expensive computation. In this work, we propose to add auxiliary predictions in a residual network to generate anytime predictions, and optimize these predictions simultaneously. We solve this multi-objective optimization by minimizing a carefully constructed weighted sum of losses. We also oscillate weightings of the losses in each iteration to avoid spurious solutions that are optimal for the sum but not for each individual loss. The proposed approach produces competitive results if computation is interrupted early, and the same level of performance as the original network once computation is finished. Observing that the relative performance gap between the optimal and our proposed anytime network shrinks as the network is near completion, we propose a method to combine anytime networks to achieve more accurate anytime predictions with a constant fraction of additional cost. We evaluate the proposed methods on real-world visual recognition data-sets to demonstrate their anytime performance.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06832
Classification of Radiology Reports Using Neural Attention Models;Bonggun Shin, Falgun H. Chokshi, Timothy Lee, Jinho D. Choi;"The electronic health record (EHR) contains a large amount of multi-dimensional and unstructured clinical data of significant operational and research value. Distinguished from previous studies, our approach embraces a double-annotated dataset and strays away from obscure ""black-box"" models to comprehensive deep learning models. In this paper, we present a novel neural attention mechanism that not only classifies clinically important findings. Specifically, convolutional neural networks (CNN) with attention analysis are used to classify radiology head computed tomography reports based on five categories that radiologists would account for in assessing acute and communicable findings in daily practice. The experiments show that our CNN attention models outperform non-neural models, especially when trained on a larger dataset. Our attention analysis demonstrates the intuition behind the classifier's decision by generating a heatmap that highlights attended terms used by the CNN model this is valuable when potential downstream medical decisions are to be performed by human experts or the classifier information is to be used in cohort construction such as for epidemiological studies.";https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06828
Human Action Recognition System using Good Features and Multilayer Perceptron Network;Jonti Talukdar, Bhavana Mehta;Human action recognition involves the characterization of human actions through the automated analysis of video data and is integral in the development of smart computer vision systems. However, several challenges like dynamic backgrounds, camera stabilization, complex actions, occlusions etc. make action recognition in a real time and robust fashion difficult. Several complex approaches exist but are computationally intensive. This paper presents a novel approach of using a combination of good features along with iterative optical flow algorithm to compute feature vectors which are classified using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network. The use of multiple features for motion descriptors enhances the quality of tracking. Resilient backpropagation algorithm is used for training the feedforward neural network reducing the learning time. The overall system accuracy is improved by optimizing the various parameters of the multilayer perceptron network.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06794
What caused what? An irreducible account of actual causation;Larissa Albantakis, William Marshall, Erik Hoel, Giulio Tononi;"Actual causation is concerned with the question ""what caused what?"". Consider a transition between two subsequent observations within a system of elements. Even under perfect knowledge of the system, a straightforward answer to this question may not be available. Counterfactual accounts of actual causation based on graphical models, paired with system interventions, have demonstrated initial success in addressing specific problem cases. We present a formal account of actual causation, applicable to discrete dynamical systems of interacting elements, that considers all counterfactual states of a state transition from t-1 to t. Within such a transition, causal links are considered from two complementary points of view: we can ask if any occurrence at time t has an actual cause at t-1, but also if any occurrence at time t-1 has an actual effect at t. We address the problem of identifying such actual causes and actual effects in a principled manner by starting from a set of basic requirements for causation (existence, composition, information, integration, and exclusion). We present a formal framework to implement these requirements based on system manipulations and partitions. This framework is used to provide a complete causal account of the transition by identifying and quantifying the strength of all actual causes and effects linking two occurrences. Finally, we examine several exemplary cases and paradoxes of causation and show that they can be illuminated by the proposed framework for quantifying actual causation.";https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06716
The Continuous Hint Factory - Providing Hints in Vast and Sparsely Populated Edit Distance Spaces;Benjamin Paa√üen, Barbara Hammer, Thomas William Price, Tiffany Barnes, Sebastian Gross, Niels Pinkwart;Intelligent tutoring systems can support students in solving multi-step tasks by providing a hint regarding what to do next. However, engineering such next-step hints manually or using an expert model becomes infeasible if the space of possible states is too large. Therefore, several approaches have emerged to infer next-step hints automatically, relying on past student's data. Such hints typically have the form of an edit which could have been performed by capable students in the given situation, based on what past capable students have done. In this contribution we provide a mathematical framework to analyze edit-based hint policies and, based on this theory, propose a novel hint policy to provide edit hints for learning tasks with a vast state space and sparse student data. We call this technique the continuous hint factory because it embeds student data in a continuous space, in which the most likely edit can be inferred in a probabilistic sense, similar to the hint factory.;
Reinforcement Learning in POMDPs with Memoryless Options and Option-Observation Initiation Sets;Denis Steckelmacher, Diederik M. Roijers, Anna Harutyunyan, Peter Vrancx, Ann Now√©;Most real-world reinforcement learning problems have a hierarchical nature, and often exhibit some degree of partial observability. While hierarchy and partial observability are usually tackled separately, for instance by combining recurrent neural networks and options, we show that addressing both problems simultaneously is simpler and more efficient in many cases. More specifically, we make the initiation set of options conditional on the previously-executed option, and show that options with such Option-Observation Initiation Sets (OOIs) are at least as expressive as Finite State Controllers (FSCs), a state-of-the-art approach for learning in POMDPs. In contrast to other hierarchical methods in partially observable environments, OOIs are easy to design based on an intuitive description of the task, lead to explainable policies and keep the top-level and option policies memoryless. Our experiments show that OOIs allow agents to learn optimal policies in challenging POMDPs, outperforming an human-provided policy in our robotic experiment, while learning much faster than a recurrent neural network over options.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06551

These are the bases of a projected industrial-strength ""SP machine"" which, when mature, is anticipated to be the vehicle for software engineering as described in this paper. Potential benefits of this new approach to software engineering include: the automation of semi-automation of software development, with non-automatic programming of the SP system where necessary allowing programmers to concentrate on 'real-world' parallelism, without worries about parallelism to speed up processing the ambitious long-term goal of programming the SP system via written or spoken natural language reducing or eliminating the distinction between 'design' and 'implementation' reducing or eliminating operations like compiling or interpretation reducing or eliminating the need for verification of software reducing the need for an explicit process of validation of software no formal distinction between program and database potential for substantial reductions in the number of types of data file and the number of computer languages benefits for version control and reducing technical debt.";https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06665
Learning Efficient Convolutional Networks through Network Slimming;Zhuang Liu, Jianguo Li, Zhiqiang Shen, Gao Huang, Shoumeng Yan, Changshui Zhang;The deployment of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in many real world applications is largely hindered by their high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a novel learning scheme for CNNs to simultaneously 1) reduce the model size 2) decrease the run-time memory footprint and 3) lower the number of computing operations, without compromising accuracy. This is achieved by enforcing channel-level sparsity in the network in a simple but effective way. Different from many existing approaches, the proposed method directly applies to modern CNN architectures, introduces minimum overhead to the training process, and requires no special software/hardware accelerators for the resulting models. We call our approach network slimming, which takes wide and large networks as input models, but during training insignificant channels are automatically identified and pruned afterwards, yielding thin and compact models with comparable accuracy. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with several state-of-the-art CNN models, including VGGNet, ResNet and DenseNet, on various image classification datasets. For VGGNet, a multi-pass version of network slimming gives a 20x reduction in model size and a 5x reduction in computing operations.;https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06519
